3705696,3705696,2019-12-10 17:23:31,"&gt;Reminder that btc is not anonymous and can be traced even after tumbling. use monero.

I must, respectfully, take issue with this. I believe I'm the only person ever to track btc through a tumbler successfully, and it was a special, one-off case.

The owner of SheepMarketplace stole 59,000 btc, and one of them was mine. After following the bitcoin for days, it started splitting into three, twice a minute, for 6 hours so I knew it was being tumbled through bitcoinfog (an excellent tumbler). Eventually it was in thousands of wallets, in tiny fragments.

Normally, if you deposit a bitcoin into bitcoinfog, SOMEBODY ELSE'S BITCOIN  from last week is tumbled and cleaned for you ie coin mixing/swapping, which is UNTRACKABLE. It breaks the path. And it's usually a slightly higher or lower sum.

However, bitcoinfog didn't already have 59,000btc on account to tumble, nobody has that much, so the stolen lump of bitcoin went straight through. I followed the largest of the 3 lumps of btc at each stage as they got smaller and smaller. Then halfway through, they started getting bigger again, re-aggregating like a snowball gathering snow, until I found myself in a wallet with exactly 59,000btc in it! You can imagine my glee. I'd been smoking Black Magic for 4 days to stay awake and I had square eyes from staring at blockchain.info. My concentration was lazer-like. I posted the current wallet on Reddit every day when the thief was asleep, while everybody trolled me as a stupid limey tweaker, wasting my time on a pointless endeavor.

You can also imagine the panic when I fired 0.000666btc into the wallet! I ""666""d him good! The bitcoin started moving again immediately. It's like catching the thief in a bank, throwing small change in his face and shouting ""WHERE'S MY FUCKING BITCOIN? WHERE'S MY FUCKING BITCOIN?"".; I could feel his panic through the blockchain. He thought he'd shaken me off.

But that was a one-off. For normal amounts of btc, coin swap/mixing/tumbling is fine.",1

This is both not true and misleadingly worded. First of all, it's using the word ""mainnet"" wrong. Lightning is just as much mainnet as on-chain (on-chain is what the author meant). 

Also, funds cannot be on lightning and somehow not on chain. They're either on chain or they're on both. Splice/loop in/out can be used to send and receive on chain funds from your lightning balance (tho I'm not sure how many lightning clients support that).

Maybe they're not quite baked properly yet. I feel they need just one more innovation to take off - and not necessarily a technical one. TOR was a US government invention, maybe there's another one of their own weapons that can be turned against them? Perhaps there's a solution that is so simple that we're just not seeing it?

Do we really NEED to login, as such? Could our bitcoin deposit somehow open the door? That would make DDOS too expensive.

Could we have a market app, like a full client bitcoin wallet, and the market data is in a blockchain which is distributed on thousands of PCs belonging to vendors and customers? Any changes to the market are included in the next block. Could something like the etherium blockchain be used? Nobody in charge, just a pool of ordinary users chosen at random to rule on escrow disputes and banning scammers, like a random 3 man jury, paid a small fee from the marketplace's 3% transaction charge. Every year, the marketplace just wipes and starts again. The market's developer simply gets a bitcoin payment from his invention every week. There are no admins.

I remember when the mp3 sharing site Napster was closed down, it was already too late. People's thinking had irevocably changed, I knew I was never going to pay for music again. Try to imagine us going back to doing ""deals"" face-to-face in an alleyway? LE should be careful what they wish for.

The most-resilient markets will succeed, by Darwinistic natural selection. Maybe they're too big, like the dinosaurs. LE are just applying ""evolutionary pressure"", this produces rapid evolution.

Their current banks would likely go defunct or forced to adopt a bitcoin-based solution which will (when done reliably) take a few years minimum. So if you immediately announce it you plunge your banking economy into disarray, which could possibly create a chain reaction but also could be benign and limited to finance. You would need to announce that you're adopting BTC years in advance for a smooth transition.

Tourism might go up, that'd be a pretty neat selling point. Any tracking data you had on your citizens via their finances is kaput.

Trade with other countries would likely be difficult as your entire GDP fluctuates as Bitcoin does, which makes you less reliable as a trade partner. You'd need a very self-sustaining, closed economy to avoid any negative global trade effects.

Be wary of pissing off Russia, US, or China! Economic sanctions? Please. We'll just have our KGB or CIA start a BTC dump. Dump it low enough and in our respective fiat currency we buy your entire country.

Unless this ""small nation"" is Mountain View, California, you'd need to import a shit ton of developers to build out the infrastructure.

You might be able to pull off a second layer of physical currencies representing Bitcoin but to be frank I have no idea where you'd begin on that, mostly because of the huge can of worms you open by going back to the problems of physical currency.

So it seems like those who become newly dependent on the government will be the homeless who previously were not receiving welfare, and were dependent on others for handouts. Everyone else will experience lifestyle creep, and a certain percentage of them would need to decrease their lifestyle if the government took away their UBI.

3763966,3763966,2019-12-10 21:50:18,"The solution is to improve self-service/DIY bitcoin acceptance with a way to protect against price volatility, so that the merchant sees little difference between using a merchant payment processor and a self-service/DIY method.

For instance, for the bitcoins received, ... a bot could do hedging on BitMEX ... essentially creating a synthetic USD for the merchant's revenues until the time the merchant spends them.   When the merchant eventually spends those BTC revenues, the synthetic USD gets closed.  

This matches the merchant's needs ... to not be exposed to exchange rate risk.

Additionally, the merchant may not have enough vendors, staff, etc, who will accept bitcoin payment, so the merchant does need also a way to convert bitcoin to fiat (e.g., cash).    Interestingly, ... at the exact same time there are many bitcoin investors locally, looking for repeat sellers of bitcoin who accept cash / NoKYC.   Hmm ... see a match there?

There are many ways to make it so merchants aren't having to be pressured into accepting bitcoin, but rather that merchants themselves are the ones pushing to use bitcoin as a payment method.  Especially with the self-serv / DIY approaches!   We just need to get the solutions to the couple of hangup points merchants have with it yet.",1

Alcoa has one of the worse environmental records in the USA. These jobs are really fabrication.  I don’t think anyone is running smelting operations there.  By products are pretty toxic. But jobs come first.

They said it.  20 months ago.

&gt;I've pointed you to the LN whitepaper author saying LN needs 133MB blocks when you said he didn't say that.

'The LN whitepaper author' you don't even realize how stupid that statement is.  There isn't just one LN implementation.  We most likely wont be using the Dryja-Poon version of the LN for much longer than 2 years.  Look up Eltoo.  And neither of us know what the base blocksize(weight) will be just a few years into the future, nor which additional signature aggregation techniques will have been deployed.  This is what I'm saying,  you have no imagination. 

You can point out all you want.  It doesn't make it true or plausible.

&gt;Why should I believe anything else you have to say

You should be able to answer that based on the lack of your own understanding of this tech.  You've made several false assumptions regarding the LN already yet you still try to critique it.

&gt;I don't know what your point is with that link. That bitcoin core is the fastest at validating the chain from genesis at 9h? Flowee can validate from genesis in 2h.

It's just over 6 hours.  **And bch blocks are almost entirely empty.**  Of course it syncs fast, **there's nothing to sync.**



&gt;But you can make a deal with an empty promise that you have no intention of ever delivering on.

And you can be stupid enough to fall for such tactics. You can simply change your mind the next day too.

&gt;Why would I want to spend to receive?

To get inbound capacity.  You described your struggle with attaining that.

&gt;What if I just want to receive.

There are a few place that you can request inbound capacity for free.  LNBig being one of them.  See Loop-Out.  Also, dual funded channels will be a possibility at some point into he future. 

&gt;There are some situations where this just isn't practical.

It requires very minimal effort.  You just want free pros with no cons which isn't a realistic or reasonable desire.

&gt;To be fair I haven't looked into what a loop out service is. I expect you'll have to pay for that as well though.

Yes you have to pay a small TX fee. It's such a shame that people won't just do things for free for you all the time...

&gt;Again, not always practical. This means you have to already have the same amount that you expect to receive.

Most people obtain their Bitcoin from an exchange so no, not that impractical. The last sentence makes no sense whatsoever.   More silly false assumptions regarding the LN on your part.

&gt;On LN you have to download the whole network graph which is changing all the time

Which syncs in a free seconds.  You update the current state, not re-doenload it every time.  Your node syncs 24/7.

&gt;Do I have to try and drag that link out for you as well?

No.  I already know this from actual real world experience.   That's where my knowledge comes from.  Not simply copy/pasting from a whitepaper in an attempt to seem knowledgeable.

&gt;I'm not interested in some software that might, one day, perhaps, happen to eventually solve all the problems. That is usually called vaporware. I'm interested in what we have today.

What we have today doesn't solve all the problems though.

&gt;Bitcoin is hardly beta anymore. To say it is, is just being dishonest.

Yes it is.  The clue is in the version number.  We haven't attained version 1.0 yet.

3764509,3764509,2019-12-10 19:58:05,"Most bitcoin-accepting merchants don't even touch the bitcoin.    A merchant processor converts the bitcoin to the value in Fiat (e.g., Dollars) and pays the merchant in fiat.  So the merchant only computes taxes on the fiat revenue numbers, and there's no recognition of bitcoin whatsoever.

There are also many merchants that do accept bitcoin where they hold the coins as investment, or for future payment to vendors, staff, investors, etc.  In those instances, the merchant would record the value in fiat for the bitcoin when the payment was made, and then when the bitcoin is eventually sold or spent they would calculate the gains (or losses) using the acquisition cost used when it was revenue as the ""cost basis"".   

So yes, there's some recordkeeping involved if you DIY (do-it-yourself).  That's a growing area though, thanks to innovations like BTCPay Server, which makes it very easy and convenient for the e-commerce site, or retail/point-of-sale use case even.

But it doesn't need necesssarily to be for every transaction.  A merchant could use daily bitcoin revenue totals though and use a ""closing price"" when computing the revenue in fiat for the day.  And the merchant would then use that same value as the ""cost basis"" of that coin going forward.

I honestly didn't expect to make it as far as I did when I went there, figured I get shot latest after a year or so, but figured it was better than to rot in Switzerland with a fucking bank job LOL

If I wanted to find someone to found a family with I'd go to Portugal, because when it comes to women I've got to say that I noticed that the smartest and most beautiful ones I've encountered so far are kind of originating from there.

It's pretty cool that now I actually gathered so much experience that I would actually be qualified to work in some assembly lines, like BitCoin ATM manufacturing or so.

However, for now the business is going ok, so I can't just run away somewhere.

But honestly, ironically. Many people go to China because of the women, I might just leave exactly because of them ������",1

3766015,3766015,2019-12-10 21:40:00,"&gt; can anyone give me tips?

Yeah... bitcoin works off of something called ""keys"".  They are secrets that only you know.  If anyone else finds them, they ""win"" your bitcoin.  Most bitcoin software today (""wallets"") use something called a ""seed"" or ""mnemonic"" with the aid of a ""passphrase"" of your choosing to encode the secrets (""keys"").

1. Don't tell anyone your seed or passphrase.
2. If someone asks for it, say no.
3. Don't forget your seed or passphrase.
4. If your forget your seed or passphrase, your coins are lost forever.
5. Forever means you will never get them back.
6. If you download ""Bitcoin Pro"" and enter your seed and passphrase into it, you will be robbed.
7. Never give sketchy SW your seed or passphrase.
8. If you don't know if SW is sketchy, than its sketchy.
9. Don't forget your seed or passphrase.
10. If someone said your bitcoins are corrupted and they need your seed and passphrase to repair them, they are lying.

BTW... don't forget or disclose your seed and passphrase to anyone... ever... for any reason... at all.

Think that about covers it.",1

Wut? The system is rigged because it's unfair, how is that complaining?

&gt;Like you said below I'm just like a 4 years old so pls eli4 your thoughts about our financial system.

I already did and even then you were too stupid to understand it

&gt; Because right now our money is controlled by the elite?

And how will going back to the gold standard change that?

&gt;Don't you know that banks can print money and thus devalue your money and your savings on demand?(which is exactly why the rich don't hold a lot of money, they have assets and debt)

They would keep their money invested even if inflation wasn't a thing

&gt;They can also decide who use the money, why and when they use it (they can block you transaction or freeze your account).

They could do that even if the gold standard wasn't a thing

&gt;A decentralized and censorship-resistant banking system would prevent that from happening.

That's not the same as the gold standard, and how exactly would we go about achieving that?

&gt;A free borderless banking system could bank the unbanked. Do you know that there's around 1.7billion adult around the world that don't even have a bank account?
&gt;A borderless system with low fees could help a lot of people that need to send money to their family living in an other country. Do you know that if I want to send 100$ to my hypothetical family in Mexico I have to pay 10$ to MoneyGram? That some high fees if you ask me.

So rather than the gold standard what you're proposing is bitcoin? 

&gt; I think that would help the people that are truly suffering from our current way of transacting value or ""financial system"".

People aren't suffering from the financial system because of transaction fees, they're suffering because of the loan system

&gt; Wouldn't it be wonderful if gold 2.0 with all these characteristics existed?

Won't happen tho

If I could just decide, on my own, how much Bitcoin I had, and so could you, that would be decentralized.  Like how art is decentralized, so that anyone can be an artist, while making art in any way they want, without any central governance regulating how it's done.

Consensus governance is indeed centralization in the sense of how systems work.

What Bitcoin is is open/public and global in it's centralized governance.  This is in contrast to national currencies which, while sort of democratic, only really have some folks voting for the folks who make decisions, or appoint others to make decisions, about how the currency is generated and allocated.

As for ""wrong"" or ""right"" this is is just geometry, really.  You just look at how a system functions, and see if the individual behavior is predictable (centralized rules) or chaotic (decentralized rules).  With any currency, for it to be useful, it has to be predictable, which is why Bitcoin is even better than US$ which is less predictable, as the government can decide to print more, or less, at any time, while Bitcoin's generation is highly regulated.",1

I'd attribute that the term FinTech is maturing, hence more people know what it means. The financial industry is huge and the disruption potential is still there, there are so many inefficient processes to fix. And now with the decentralized finance movement I can't see it stopping. We will see a correction with the unicorns, eg challenger banks struggling to get to profitability but I don't expect a massive drop in investment interest. Especially with interest rates so low, capital is free money.

Financial services are now experiencing a new unbundling-bundling cycle fuelled by deregulation in certain areas of the industry- just look up open banking in Europe. Market consolidation theory goes in 4 cycles and there's a slow move from 4 to 1 again. Investment banks are not as profitable, monopolies in commercial banking are forced to play the margin game to the bottom to compete. Similar forces are playing in market intelligence tools too, multiple challengers coming up with enriched data for indexes while bloomberg et al are sitting on their hands.",1

3768122,3768122,2019-12-10 16:06:38,"&gt; Anyone thought though this problem yet?

Of course, ad Satoshi was the first to think it through.

And yes, it boils down to transaction fees needing to carry the freight, so to speak.   And it will come a lot sooner than 2140, as in five months we have just 900 BTC mined per day,... and in 2024 it will be just 450 mined per day, and in 2028 it will be just 225 mined per day, etc.

At the same time, bitcoin doesn't need the total of 7,500 MW mining that it has today to remain secure.  Was bitcoin less secure in June when it consumed just 4,000 MW?   No.  The reason it has 7,500 MW of hashrate today is because 12.5 BTC / block X 144 blocks / day X $7,350 USD per BTC results in enough revenue to support 7,500 MW of mining activity.

After the halving, the less efficient equipment will get powered off, and existing equipment that is efficient will change owners, flowing from areas where electricity is not ultra cheap to areas where miners compete when paying just $0.05 per kWh or less. 

Unless, ... of course, there is a spike in the price, then miners are able to ""keep the lights on"" even with less-efficient rigs and/or a higher cost per kWh.",1

3768466,3768466,2019-12-10 00:11:37,"I oversimplify a bit:  
Your Bitcoin are stored on a global ledger called Blockchain. Actually there are no Bitcoin. The ledger just says public address x has that amount in it. Like a bank account. But to be able to spend from that account you need your private key. Like your login to your account.  
With the private key you sign a message: here is proof that I can sign to another address. The signing of that message does the software or wallet. 

On a paper wallet you can not transmit per se. But you can recieve. I sign a message that I send some money to your address. Now in the global ledger your amount has been increased.

A paper wallet can not sign a message/transaction. Therefore you need to import your private key to a software. Either on your phone or on a hardware wallet. Now you can sign your transaction (tx) from there. It is a bit more complicated that's why it is important you sweep your full amount or you will loose some money. Sweeping is signing a tx and sending the full amount and therefore sending to an public address on your phone. This is important because when you spend partial from your paper wallet, you can not access the return address of your change because your paper wallet is dumb. Only sweep full amount from your paper wallet. Never spending part of it.

I think you could do it as a soft fork. The issue seemed to be that Bram Cohen had a different idea about how it should be implemented to Peter Todd which caused both proposals to stall, and after something is left unimplemented for long enough in bitcoin they create some kind of pseudo-security rationale about why it's better not to have it, and this then hardens into dogma, after which you can no longer add it even if you can agree on how.",1

I believe that if enough of the common people hodl and begin introducing there own methods of transactions through Bitcoin (collectively we're smarter than corporations) if and when the world banks collapse we'll end up turning to crypto. The rich certainly will. Just look at the trading volume with something like bakkts or the CME.

As someone who is into investing and talking with many others who are as well it’s basically impossible to predict how it’s going to move. Cash is much more steady as today $1 is worth $1 and it will be tomorrow too. Yes there’s inflation but it’s generally very slow and over time. You can have $10 in crypto today and tomorrow it could be worth 50¢. One day you could afford a new house outright and the next you might not even be able to afford a Honda Civic. And The markets for everything would be all over the place if they tried to adjust based on what the value was at that day. I also don’t think businesses could ever accept it.

3772632,3772632,2019-12-10 08:56:54,"Makes no sense to me.

Buy an S17 Pro, ..e.g., $2,300 (no idea if that's accurate, just a rough guess.), or 0.315 BTC at $7,300 BTC/uSD.

Now the aim is to get back more than 0.315 BTC.

This thing, at 53 TH/s will generate ~0.001 BTC per day at the current hashrate. In 157 days, roughly,  the halving occurs, after which this rig will then generate 0.0005 BTC per day.    And that's not even accounting for the cost of electricity.

So you get 0.157 BTC for the 157 days before halving, so that gets you halfway to getting your 0.315 BTC back. But then with 0.0005 per day, that requires 316 days at the current hashrate.   If difficulty rises, this generates even less bitcoin per day, taking longer than 316 days.

There's like no upside to buying this mining rig today.  Just hold onto your 0.315 BTC and thank me when it spikes in price that you still have 0.315 and not just a fraction of that plus some 2,100W money-losing mining rig instead.

Now let's say six months from now, BTC/USD is still $7,300 and there's nobody wanting these rigs, so they drop the price from $2,300 to $800 (a 65% drop ). Then, you only need 0.11 BTC to buy the rig, which finally might make economic sense because amortized CapEx is lower.   Makes a lot better sense to risk just 0.11 BTC then rather than 0.315 BTC now.

[Update: Ok, the price on that S17 Pro 53 TH/s was off.  It's now ... ~$1,322.  The 73 TH/s (shipping next month) is $1,930.

The way I see it you have Bitcoin, the concept, as described in the white paper. 


You have Bitcoin, the currencies, (XBT/BTC), Bitcoin Cash(~~BCC~~,~~BAB~~,BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV) etc. 


And you have the Bitcoin implementations, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin ABC etc.



The white paper describes Bitcoin as a peer to peer electronic cash system, a currency if you will. A currency doesn't become a store of value unless it has all the properties of sound money i.e. it's fungible, divisible, portable, durable, acceptable, limited in supply and maintains it's value over time.",1

- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated that you are in the U.K., and that you would like to maintain your financial privacy (i.e., by not revealing your age).

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card.  A NoKYC method will not request your identification/KYC. (e.g., Rebiton [**NO-KYC**], CoinCorner [[��](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], CEX.io, Coinify, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreland, Kuna.io Money, LiteBit.eu, Conio.com, GetSatsoshi.org ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

Otherwise, there are P2P trading exchanges which are similar to LocalBitcoins which you are already familiar with that are NoKYC. You may find these to possibly be your next best option.  There are sellers accepting GBP bank transfer on many of the markets (e.g., HodlHodl, Bisq, LocalCoinSwap, LocalCryptos, etc.)

&gt;I recall this very good read

Yes, it is very good read indeed. It says that ether creates alternative financial system. It also explains why exactly it has to be created, i.e. what's wrong with the existing one. The author even bolded-out the reason: : *this financial system has the capacity to be completely open and trustless.*  ""Open"" means permissionless. Further in the text it is explained in more detail. The author draws two pyramids side by side: old system and new system. In the old system at every level it says ""asks permission"". In the new system, at every level it says ""permissionless"". That's the reason the new, alternative system is being created. To be able to run your finances without need to ask states/banks for permission.

&gt;nothing stops the state to utilize the same technology

The technology is not of much use for states. They don't need permissions, they gave them.

&gt;or block any of this.

The crypto is specifically designed to be hard to block/control. To make it controllable one have to modify it first. And to modify crypto you have to control developers. Say, put one of them to prison, so the rest will get scared and cow towed.

&gt;just as a knife can enable you to cut things but if you used it to cut someone's head off, you are going to jail.

Knife is a good example, but I would suggest cars vs guns. You can kill with a gun and you can kill with a car, but guns are banned in many countries, while cars are not.  Why? Because killing is the major purpose of gun, while it is not major purpose of car. The major purpose of crypto is (as explained in the link that you've provided) is breaking state's and bank's bans. That's why it's not in state's interests to let us use crypto.

&gt;You regulate. Introduce KYC on entry and exit points (where it matters).

Right. Create an alternative financial system with the sole purpose of avoiding permisssions and then add permissions to it. Why then bother to create it at all?

&gt;With the exception of privacy coins, anyone can track where the money goes.

Vitalik, among others, often says how important is privacy for crypto. The only reason ETH is not a privacy coin yet is lack of scalability: private transactions and contracts are too expensive. But after sharding and L2 give us scalability, this obstacle will go. ETH2.3 will be a privacy coin. And, as such, a threat to state.

&gt;I am not breaking the law.

You are discussing the tool for breaking the law. Just like Vigil did. Before state arrested crypto people only for using crypto (Silk Road, Btc-E). It's the first time a crypto person is arrested for *talking* about crypto. And, as I said before, making tool is more important than talking about it. So no one making a crypto tool should feel safe from now on.

&gt;Trump travelled to NK, albeit for very short distance. Is he criminal as well?  
&gt;  
&gt;Silly question

Not really, just an unusual one. We just get used to situation where state bans us from doing thing they are doing themselves. You are not allowed to print dollars, tax people, put them to prison, issue laws and wage wars. States allowed themselves do all of it. State people have huge privileges over us, common folk. You consider it normal just because nobody in your circle challenges it. It's like in Medieval Age everybody believed in King's inherited rights to reign not because it was true, but because they were taught to believe. Just the same, we are taught to believe that we need state's permission for everything we do. The new, permissionless world will change it. But state won't give up it's power over us easily. The Vigil's case is just a beginning.

&gt;Is it a crime? 7 billion people are not US citizens.  
&gt;  
&gt;No and no one is saying it is.

Then why it's mentioned it in the list of ""crimes"" he committed? Just to paint him a villain?

&gt;Back to my knife scenario.... in the hands of a good person or a chef, a knife can be a very good thing.

As I've said above, crypto is more like a gun, than like a car. States don't like us having guns, because gun's major puprose is killing and in state's view the only one that should be allowed to kill is the state itself. From point of state's interests, a tool, the major purpose of which is breaking state's bans, is not a car, but a gun. It's just a matter of time before states realise that banning all crypto and persecuting/controlling all crypto developers is in state's interests.

&gt;Government surely don't want it to happen. And they'll try to destroy dollar's competitor, the crypto. By leaning on developers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Is this for real? I mean, it's got tin foil hat written all over it.

Probably the whole Unisvap team has the tinfoil over their heads as well. That's why, just several days after Vigil's arrest, they've blocked a number of countries from their interface. It's just a tinfoil, not the fact that they live in USA and don't want to be arrested. And imprisonment of creators of bitcoin's predecessors (E-Gold, Liberty Reserve etc) is just a figment of my imagination.

&gt;There are a lot of people in to crypto now, Virgil is 1 guy.

He is not the 1 guy, he is the first guy. Before they could not arrest you for talking about crypto. Now they can.

&gt;100% did the wrong thing. The fact that Vitalik said that if he knew that the issue is this big, he would have opposed the travel a whole lot more tells us that he acknowledge Virgil's wrong doing.

There is a difference between between doing risky things and doing bad things. Vigil underestimated the risks and didn't took safety measures. AFAIK, all they have on him, is provided by Vigil himself. He should not be asking permissions to travel to NK, he should not be posting NK visa on Twitter, he should not be talking to FBI at all.

3780796,3780796,2019-12-10 23:37:25,"&gt; Consensus governance is indeed centralization in the sense of how systems work.

There's no such thing. It's consensus or it's not. Explain how the BCH fork came to exist if there is ""centralization"". Explain why Counterparty exists. Why do alts exist? There is no such thing as centralization of cryptocurencies. There is either consensus or there is no consensus and a fork happens. 

Sidechains are possible, colored coins are technically possible with EPOBC right now. Coinprism even ran an implementation for a while and users chose not to use it. There are certainly ways people could shard the resource value of Bitcoins to offer different governance options and models. Hell, you could probably even do federated coins in such a manner if you didn't want to sidechain.

I'm sorry that you do not understand these things, if you want to look into them more I've given you plenty of terms and acronyms to Google to expand upon. Even in Bitcoin's ""governance"" (if you really want to call it that) right now there really is no centralization, only consensus. All Bitcoin did was solve the Byzantine General's problem and that's a consensus issue in distributed computing systems. It's not ""governance"". You either have consensus or you do not.",1

3784716,3784716,2019-12-10 13:12:15,"&gt;Wut? The system is rigged because it's unfair, how is that complaining?

The definition of complaining is ""to express dissatisfaction about something"" so you're complaining again buddy.

&gt;I already did and even then you were too stupid to understand it

You haven't explained shit. You said ""only people with a lot of money can make more money"" which is totally untrue and ""The system is rigged because it's unfair"" which sound just like a 4 years old complaining.

&gt;And how will going back to the gold standard change that?

A decentralized system would fix that.

&gt;They would keep their money invested even if inflation wasn't a thing

yep, but my point was that only the average person take the hit. Not the rich.

&gt;&gt;They can also decide who use the money, why and when they use it (they can block you transaction or freeze your account).

&gt;They could do that even if the gold standard wasn't a thing

Not with a neutral and censorship-resistant banking system

&gt;&gt;A decentralized and censorship-resistant banking system would prevent that from happening.

&gt;That's not the same as the gold standard, and how exactly would we go about achieving that?

Bitcoin already achieve that.

&gt;So rather than the gold standard what you're proposing is bitcoin?

Bingo!

&gt;People aren't suffering from the financial system because of transaction fees, they're suffering because of the loan system

I'd argue that the poor people with no efficient way to transact money are suffering more than american that CHOSE to get a loan so they could buy their cars, house or school. You're not forced to get a loan. That's some first world problem right there.

When I think about it, I guess it makes some sense. It's like if I dug up some gold, or created bitcoin; that would add a form of currency to the economy, and devalue all other currency. (Of course, loans don't generally devalue currency, because they are expected to be paid back eventually.)",1

However if you try to exchange 7,3k dollars into 47 dollars, the market would just ignore you. Even when giving back the rest in bitcoin, since you are offering a guarantee of less than 1% of the current price, the market would ignore you anyway in today's situation. 

But if you now presume that you are keeping up your promise and things develop bad for bitcoin - at a price of 1k dollars, with gold having maybe soared to 900 dollars, you would face a lot of claims to exchange bitcoin against gold with the guarantee you offered, which would represent a 90% backing in this new scenario.",1

Many traders are hopping on the Bitcoin 4 year cycle train, which if that is true, then 2020 will be year where BTC tests and ultimately passes 20k and 2021 will be the moon year where BTC reaches new highs, which have in the past been 10x that of the previous high, so we could see 1 Bitcoin = $200,000 USD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Selling any crypto now, if you've held all the way to the bottom is playing with fire. When things come back, they'll move quick. Selling ELA at $1.60 with the hopes to acquire more at $1.20 IF that happens, is a pretty risky strategy for most, there's a good chance that doesn't happen, Bitcoin/alts pump and then you end up Fomoing back in but with less ELA than you had.

Decentralized means that everyone is doing their own thing, and it's chaotic and unpredictable.

It would be far better for folks who are interested in Bitcoin to be more logical and clear about what we mean when we talk about the differences between Bitcoin and other currencies.

There has been attempts at solving a particular problem in computer science for a long time, what we call the double spend problem which is related to the Byzantine Generals Problem. And once a solution (probabilistic in the case of Bitcoin) to that problem was found it would by default also create cryptocurrency since what it would mean was that it is possible to issue tokens that people can transfer to each other without intermediates. That is the first and most obvious use case, a practical example and a kind of social experiment, it is the first thing a human would do.  


For the sake of the argument, if an AGI wanted to covertly spread the tools that was useful for itself later, it would do it in a way that did not seem to make sense for humans, in fear of us finding out and shutting it down. It would collaborate with some human computer scientist who first solved the double spend problem, then published it, just to then see it be implemented into various crypto by various actual humans. Anything smart enough to create a cryptocurrency as a step of a plan to dominate the world would not do it the way that SN did. Unless the argument is that the AGI would do things that nobody would suspect an AGI of doing because it was exactly what an AGI would not do - but then we are assuming that AGI is SN and now we are trying to justify it, which is not the right way to go about finding the truth about anything.",1

3792257,3792257,2019-12-10 06:18:28,"You have the horse before the cart.

The reason bitcoin is worth $133B today is not because that's what 7,500 MW of mining is worth.  The reason we have 7,500 MW of mining is because is because that's the right amount for the revenues that the miners earn.

Gross revenue of all miners is: 

144 blocks / day X 12.5 BTC / block X $7,300 USD per BTC = $13.1M per day of revenue for miners.  

If a typical S9 rig consumes 33.6 kWh per day (1.4 KW X 24 hours/day), and competitive mining operators pay $0.05 per kWh, that means $1.68 (33.6 X $0.05) is spent on electricity per rig per day.

Add about 50% of that for CapEx amortization and operating costs, and you end up with $2.52 ($1.68 X 1.5) per day ""spent"" per rig.  

So how many rigs does $13.1M revenue per day support?  $13.1 / $2.52 = ~5.2M rigs.

Each rig is 1,400W, so 5.2M rigs would use 7,200 GW (1,400 W/rig X (1 KW /  1000 W) X (1 MW / 1000 KW) X 5,200,000 rigs) 

The hashrate on CBECI is at this moment ~7.5 GW (or 7,500 MW), which calculates a slightly different way, but otherwise reaches essentially the same ballpark value for consumption:

- https://www.cbeci.org

In summary,  Price drives hashrate.  Hashrate (and thus, electricity consumption) has no impact on price.",1

my concern is that many exchanges will only promise coin delivery from 1 minute to 24 hours, which is most unsatisfying. so besides the average time, i asked for above, do you have a ""policy"" on a maximum time as well? (i admit, i haven't read your docs yet)

People everywhere being trained to accept extreme personal intrusion and addicted to debt is not a good thing. It's extremely unpleasant. It's also much harsher on the environment when people buy endless products they don't need and can't afford, only to throw them away.

A modified form of lending, automatically operated without force or any intrusion, happens with a smart contract and cryptocurrency as collateral, although I haven't used that part of the smart contract, but I've used the token.",1

Why do you think you can’t tell money to go make you a sandwich?

&gt; No, revenue is generated from ALL factors of production. Labor itself is not generating revenue.

Labor and natural capital were the first factors of production.

Natural capital was always here, but labor was what created more capital throughout the ages.

&gt; Anecdote is not data, nor is it the usual course of business.

I countered your hypothetical framework as to why this was impossible with a story of it happening right now in the real world.

This case (and others like it) shouldn’t be possible under your framework.

&gt; Irrelevant. Your argument was equating the two, and they are not the same. 

My argument did not necessitate that CEOs are capitalists, just that they often are.

&gt; The fact that some feudal lords became capitalists in the UK is not how all capitalism arises.

It’s how all original capitalist systems arose. Look up primitive accumulation.

&gt; No, the actual data shows that socialists are the NEETs while AnCaps are out working their jobs.

&gt;and in fact there should be a spec, not a reference client. 

Seriously,  read that link.

&gt;How do you differentiate the bitcoin core chain from all the other bitcoin chains then?

There isn't a Bitcoin Core chain (except I think somebody did make an altcoin called Bitcoin Core which isn't relevant here)  Are you being serious now?  I can't tell.

&gt;Are you denying that Adam Back flew to Hong Kong to make an agreement, making sure the top 8 miners only ran bitcoin core?

No.  Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol.  I don't care what one individual did or didn't do.  It's irrelevant.   I told you already,  you can't force people to run code if they don't want to.

&gt;I understand all this. What I am saying is that there are services that will charge you to open a channel to you. I could only find 1 that did not charge. 

Yeah I'm guessing that would have been LNBig.  You can just spend some funds to get incoming capacity or use a loop out service.  Or open a channel to an exchange and send half the channel capacity to the exchange.. plenty of options. 

&gt;So if I don't have a watchtower and i'm not running a node is my money safe?

Yes.  Mobile wallets default their Time Lock Delta to to 2,016 blocks.  You only need to get an internet connection to your phone once every 2 weeks.  Even after that, game theory and financial incentives make channel fund theft an extremely unlikely event.  If you're using a desktop wallet you may alter this setting to whatever you want.  Or, you know, just go ahead and add a watchtower anyway.  Altruistic watchtowers have been active from LND 0.7 if I recall correctly.   I've added 4 to my node and allowed people to use mine.  It's free and runs in the background automatically. 


&gt;No. Whenever there is a complaint about LN we're told it's not ready.

No.


&gt;It has however also been shown that LN doesn't scale and therefore will likely never be ready. 

No it hasn't.  Think about what you're saying.  You and I have no idea what additions &amp; new tech will be incorporated into the Bitcoin protocol in just W years time, let alone a decade into the future &amp; beyond.

&gt;You can apply the beta tag all you want be we've had bitcoin for 10 years now. Maybe you're going with Google's definition of beta.

11 years now.  And I'm using the general and widely accepted definition of Beta (software).

&gt;If all Bitcoin transactions were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year).

The problem of validating the authenticity of the app will always exist - phishing scams will always exist.

How is a program better than an html file?

A nice non-html app could be a simple way to transfer bitcoin from a paper wallet (or a seed phrase) to a new address. Many people receive their first bitcoin from a friend on a paper wallet. When they eventually buy a hardware wallet or just install a smartphone app, it is not trivial to transfer the coins from the paper wallet to the new wallet.

There are [currently 12](https://coin.dance/nodes) Bitcoin reference clients to choose from.  One is names Core and it doesn't have its own chain.  They all reference the the Bitcoin protocol. 

&gt;Adam Back will fly anywhere in the world to make sure only that 1 is being used.

You can't force people to run code.  It's a choice but if you do your research [you will probably run Core.](https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoin-node-performance-sync-tests/)

&gt;LN has been 18 months away for about the last 4 years.

It has been.line on main net for 20 months already.

&gt;And yes, it is the bitcoin core and LN devs that have said this

Yes, 20 months ago.

&gt;No, it's the devs that have been telling us this. 

Again, 20 months ago.  You idiots keep making this silly claim today though.

&gt;No, it's the devs that have been telling us this. 

No, see above.

&gt;The irony. 

Indeed

&gt;I tried to open a 2nd channel but the only ones I could find had to be paid for.

The channels don't exist beforehand.  A LN channel is an on chain transaction (2 of 2 multi sig) that you must pay for, unless someone opens one towards you.  You may be getting confused with some custodial service.

&gt;You need incoming liquidity to receive. 

That isn't liquidity though, you require incoming **capacity.**

&gt;So I just risk losing my money then?

No.  You learn how the LN works.

&gt;This may be the source of your misunderstanding. I never said it wasn't live

You're implying that though, which is false.

&gt;I said it wasn't ready.

It is ready.  All of crypto is still in Beta btw. 

&gt;Because that's what the devs keep telling us. 

Yes.  20 months ago.  You should use caution with any crypto at this early stage on the game.


&gt;From the original author of the LN whitepaper actually. 

**False.**

&gt;You don't appear to know what you're talking about.

Going from your description of how you think the LN works above, I really don't think you're in any position to make an assumption like that.

&gt;I suggest you look into it a bit more.

I'd suggest you take a look at [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) and consider how it may be relevant in your case.",1

Both companies have announced that they are working on improving the blockchain gaming experience. For Chainlink, this type of project is a completely new undertaking. And yet the company seems to be content to enter the blockchain gaming space.

Enigma and Chainlink announced a new collaboration, focusing on the integration of their protocols to enable powerful new use cases for secret smart contracts. Integrating Enigma’s and Chainlink’s protocols can have both near-term and longer-term benefits for developers and users. More complex integrations can maximize the combined and independent power of Enigma’s secure computation protocol and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network. One such integration is the use of Chainlink nodes to submit oracle data as tasks to Secret Contracts. Application developers will be able to use APIs available via Chainlink to trigger events in their contracts.

Ampleforth, a commodity-money, like Bitcoin or gold, but with near-perfect supply elasticity, like fiat, will be the first monetary asset to use Chainlink oracles to aggregate secure and timely off-chain pricing data for its protocol. Through the Chainlink integration, Ampleforth’s Market Oracle (volume-weighted price) and CPI Oracle (current price target) will be powered by nine different incoming price feeds from three different aggregators, which act together to determine the magnitude of AMPL’s supply adjustment every 24 hours.

I’m **Laurel Sage**, girl-next-door scientist spaz extraordinaire waiting to hear all of your fantasies and share my own! Customers like me for my infectious personality, high energy sessions, and care and compassion for every person I interact with. I enjoy lots of dirty talk, flowers, listening to records, lingerie, yoga, bondage, and pizza. And being a good girl for you of course. I love connecting with people on a more intimate and sexual level in order to get to know each other to create a more fulfilling experience. I might seem sweet, but I’m really a dirty little cum slut ready to make your dreams cum true ;)

Girl Next Door: **$50 for 1 day or $135 for 3 days**

Do you have that much money lying around?

When it comes to investing there's alot of different risks. One distinction is priced risks vs idiosyncratic risk. 

A diversified portfolio of index funds gives you exposure to the 5 factors that explain positive returns.

Buying one stock, whether it be Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, or bitcoin - you are putting all your eggs into one basket, and it is more likely for a company to fail, and have it affect you, than when it's just one of 200-3000 stocks in an index fund.",1

It is Bitcoin Core's fault just as miners for not acting. Blockstream installed and funded notable members and pushed those that were against it out. They led this pivot to suit Blockstream's product Liquid and not scaling as p2p cash. Miners stayed because as Satoshi predicted they will act towards greed in not rocking the boat.

Electricity usage has been the first method to assist network validation, since then we have seen plenty of other methods to validate transactions on a blockchain network. Network validation method’s are crucial, but it’s not the key metric to determine Bitcoin’s potential (as currency.)

To me, Bitcoin’s main intrinsic value is it’s mathmatical proven and time-tested design.
That is the unique innovation Bitcoin brings to the table when we look a medium we can use to exchange goods and services.
If you look at all properties you idialistically would want a medium of exchange to have, Bitcoin is By Far the one who gets the closest to that ideal.
Fiat has plenty of flaws, gold goes a long way up that scale, but still fals short to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is thus not backed by electricity..
Bitcoin brings guarantee of trust, without the need of a middlemen. Thus, absolute trust is Bitcoin’s prime technology.
A feature which comes in very handy when one is looking for a medium of exchange.

Core develop 1 of 4 LN implementations, you may use one of the others.  Electrum's version isn't out yet though.  And nobody is telling you that the LN will be ready in 18 months.

You don't pay for liquidity, your own Bitcoin is your liquidity and you needn't use a watchtower.  I'm not interested in convincing you to use Bitcoin buy you can't convince me that the LN hasn't been live on main net for the last 20 months.

using 0.0111x leverage means that you only use 1/100 of the speculative money on the asset. If you have 100 dollar, buying only 1 dollar worth of bitcoin achievs that deleveraging. Even if bitcoin drop to zero, your loss will be 1 dollar, which is 1% of the total value of your investment. However, if bitcoin rises 20x, you gain 20 dollar, that is 20% gain for your investment.

- https://exchangewar.info  &lt;-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card.  (e.g., Rebiton [**NO-KYC**], CoinCorner [[��](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], CEX.io, Coinify, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreland, Kuna.io Money, LiteBit.eu, Conio.com, GetSatsoshi.org ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  &lt;-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  &lt;-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  &lt;-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  &lt;-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

3809414,3809414,2019-12-10 14:01:08,"There is a cost to everything. How does this counter my argument? 

As an analogy imagine Product A costs $100 and provides $200 worth of value for a cost/benefit ratio of 2:1. Now let’s say it costs $100,000,000 over 3 years to fund research that can bring the worth to $1000. However, the demand in the market is only 10 buyers per day. That’s $365,000 per year. Even if you were able to put the price to $300, that’d still only be just over a million per year, which isn’t worth the 50 million over 3 years investment.

RnD will go nowhere unless the market attracts more demand. More demand = more RnD = cheaper costs for everyone (at $300 the cost/benefit ratio would be 3.33:1).

Labor generally moves to where the money is. By increasing demand for energy, it’s signaling to the market that society really needs this good/service, so labor moves in to provide it / make it more efficient.

Ideally, all of the world’s governments would work together to put up a huge bounty for RnD, without electricity being wasted, but we don’t live in that utopia, and capitalism is the alternative, which requires inefficiency in order to incentivize efficiency. It’s messed up, but it’s how the world works right now. If we could solve the problem of governments being dumb and not coming to consensus, we actually wouldn’t need Bitcoin.

A much smaller percentage would suffice. You *would* need to be the largest holder, by some way, but that is well below 51%. In fact, if you could move the market sufficiently, it would be a trivial exercise to gradually accumulate more and more BTC for a net cost of zero. In other words, if a big government (or more likely, a group of central banks) chose to add BTC to the SDR and hold it as a reserve component, the IMF would be a kind of Bitcoin Central Bank.

Oh wait, you live across the border.  For you, milk is much cheaper.  So with this app, after you scan the price in BTC, the cost (in gallons of milk) is 11,000.

Another merchant lists prices, not in bitcoin, but in fiat.  But this app scans that too.  $7 for the movie ticket?   Scan ... app shows 2.0  (gallons of milk).

3829921,3829921,2019-12-10 03:34:02,"A degree in a good field can tide you over through difficult times and help you build enough in savings to invest in bigger entrepreneurial ventures. Plus college is great networking if you go in planning for entrepreneurship. For instance you could have a nest egg towards creating your startup and connections to help you get it off the ground. With your drive I could see you making much more through this path.

In the grand scheme of things, 50k is not much money and you made it during a boom period. It's akin to bitcoin thousand-aires believing they are expert investors because they made a good amount of money off of one trend. YouTube videos and dropshipping are unstable and if they are your main plan for getting rich I'm skeptical. I'm not saying don't chase your dreams, but hedge your bets. If you go all in on a dying field, I fear you will end up with nothing to show for your hard work. 

Nothing that can get you rich at a young age is without risk, but the vast majority of businesses fail.

Many countries like Germany have issued tentatively positive legislation (like allowing banks to hold and trade crypto), and I think this is because they recognize that it's actually more transparent than the FIAT system.

They've been saying LN is 18 months away for a lot longer than 20 months. 

&gt; 'The LN whitepaper author' you don't even realize how stupid that statement is. There isn't just one LN implementation. 

Ok, how about the original LN. Is there another, incompatible LN? Otherwise it's the same LN protocol. How about you show me the spec of an LN that actually works then.

&gt; And bch blocks are almost entirely empty. Of course it syncs fast, there's nothing to sync.

You do realise that out of 11 years the chains share 9 years of history?

&gt; And you can be stupid enough to fall for such tactics. 

So you agree that Adam and his fellow dipshits were being deceitful.

Again, this isn't always practical. With bitcoin core I can just receive money without jumping through all these hoops.

&gt; Yes you have to pay a small TX fee. It's such a shame that people won't just do things for free for you all the time...

You mean how it doesn't cost me anything to receive and secure bitcoin cash?

&gt; The last sentence makes no sense whatsoever. More silly false assumptions regarding the LN on your part

You suggested sending money to an exchange so that I could receive. This would mean opening a channel for say 1BTC. Sending this 1BTC to the exchange. Now I can receive upto 1BTC. How else could your suggestion possibly work?

&gt; Yes it is. The clue is in the version number. We haven't attained version 1.0 yet.

3833468,3833468,2019-12-10 00:25:00,"&gt;tl;dr - if there is a fork and you can control your new coins, its a taxable event.

That is because you acquired something of value.  It needs to be determined though if it is considered income or investment dividend, or something else.  Because that will determine the tax rate.

1.  I think an argument can be made though that the airdrop was not acquired at zero cost.  For example if you only get the airdrop if you own bitcoin, then you had to acquire bitcoin at some cost.  Thus that is your cost for acquiring the airdrop.

2.  Also, I would like to argue that airdrops are gifts, and that gifts are tax free up to the limit.  I do not remember the exact gift limit, but I think it is like $13K or $15K a year.  A gift is a value that you receive without obligation.  That is, you didn't do anything to acquire the gift.

In the case of the airdrop you did not do anything to get it, it just happened.  You were not obligated to do anything of value in order to receive it.  You do not owe anyone anything for receiving it.  Sounds like a gift to me.

If I have one apple priced at a dollar, I'm not going to be able to sell you ten thousand apples at the same price because I just flooded the market. The same happens when you try to sell other types of property including stocks.

Believe me, I agree that wealth would be the most equitable way to decide who should pay taxes, but it's too arbitrary. Imagine having to pay a million dollars in wealth taxes on some Bitcoin only to see the price drop by 90% the next day.",1

The profitability hit on miners will happen much earlier than 2140, because the mining reward will only be a few Satoshis, because the speculator bubble will burst and the price will fall below $2  

&gt; Store of Value narrative

Correction, the speculation narrative. Speculators will leave Bitcoin when the price falls  

&gt; What are mining fees like these days

$0.02 is enough to have a transaction confirmed 80% of the time. Exchanges are overpaying  

&gt; unless there's a ton of transactions

Maximum transaction volume is limited by block size and block frequency, is limited to about 500k tx/day",1

3954066,3954066,2019-12-10 20:34:03,"In my earlier comment, I actually had composed a nice, long approach to explaining this, but then scrapped it because it gets to be a very long explanation unless you are very skilled at explaining things, which I am not.

I just figured out a better way to explain it.

You want to buy 1.0 bitcoin for speculation purposes.   Let's say the price on RobinHood right now is $7,150, and the price on Kraken is $7,200.   Normally they are about the same price, but today for some reason, it's a little cheaper on RobinHood. 

Which of the two do you invest in 1.0 bitcoin.    Do you really care that you cannot withdraw your 1.0 bitcoin from RobinHood?   Nope, you only are speculating on the price.   So because you are a rational buyer, you will buy the 1.0 bitcoin position on Robinhood.

Now if I'm an arbitrage trader, I look for opportunities to make a profit.  I see that I can buy a 1.0 BTC bitcoin position for $7,150 on Robinhood, and sell a 1.0 BTC for ~$7200 on Kraken.  


In my bank I have $10,000 USD and in my bitcoin wallet I have 1.0 BTC.

So I send $7,150 from my bank to Robinhood, and I send 1.0 BTC to Kraken.  A short while later I have $10,050 in my bank (after depositing $7,200 USD from Kraken that I got from selling the 1.0 BTC), and I have a 1.0 BTC position on Robinhood.   So essentially I end up with essentially the same thing as I had before doing this trade, except for me not holding a bitcoin anymore, just a 1.0 BTC position on Kraken, plus an extra $50 that was profit from the arbitrage trade.   If I'm speculating, a 1.0 BTC in my wallet and a 1.0 BTC position on Robinhood are essentially the same.  If BTC/USD rises 10% from here, I get ~10% more USDs when selling (closing) my position on Robinhood.

But as far as the market knows, I sold 1.0 BTC (on Kraken) without actually buying (taking) 1.0 BTC from some other seller.  As far as physical bitcoin goes, my selling activity depressed the price on Kraken (by reducing the level of BUY orders by 1.0 BTC).

Do this enough times, eventually the price on Kraken drops closer to the level it is on Robinhood, or the price on Robinhood rises to the level on Kraken.  Or more likely, it is a combination of both and the price meets somewhere in the middle.

How many ""long"" bitcoin positions potentially could I buy on Robinhood like this?   40M BTC, or more ... as long as there were speculators willing to put enough dollars to offer SHORT sell positions at that price.     How many bitcoins max can I sell on Kraken?  As many as I have in my wallet.  If I have 2 BTC, I can only send 2 BTC to Kraken.   I cannot sell 3 BTC on Kraken, as I don't have 3 BTC to sell.

That's the diference between physical (Kraken) and ""cash settlement"" (Robinhood), and the reason that the price on Robinhood (cash-settled marketplace) affects the price on Kraken (physical marketplace).

Now I'm not necessarily calling Robinhood a bucket shop here.  I simply do not know much more about them other than that you cannot actually withdraw actual bitcoin from them.  Therefore as far as I care (for this comment reply), they are a ""cash settled"" transaction for investment/speculation only.

Historic prices were much worse, people who build their hideout in the first month of the wipe paid a premium for items that were in high demand like nails, screws, flash drives, pressure gauges, ledx, etc. I did the same math with the prices I paid when I built my hideout, and ended at roughly 36M total.

Digital cash is a fuzzy term. It's either what already exists and is used by everyone or an oxymoron. Cash is fiat. Online banking is digital cash. If it weren't for inflationary monetary systems the concept of cash wouldn't exist.

The argument that bitcoin is too slow to be used in the same manner as people currently use cash is a valid argument, but competing standards are not the solution in the same way that a silver standard is not a solution to the impracticality of dividing physical gold for every transaction.

Because by dismissing the idea of running your own full node, you broke the very ethos of bitcoin in your opening sentence.  Everything after that is irrelevant.

Trezor, Armory, Electrum, they all are compromises to the original ideal and offer various trade-offs along the way.  If the trade-offs were a ""bad deal"" no one would use them and their use would dry up.

So, if you want to experience the ""main objective"" of Bitcoin, run your own node.  If you choose to run Trezor, Armory, or Electrum you have made the choice to make the trade off.  You don't ***have*** to make that trade.  So the ""main objective"" is still in effect.",1

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. (e.g., Rebiton [**NO-KYC**], CoinCorner [[��](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], CEX.io, Coinify, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreland, Kuna.io Money, LiteBit.eu, Conio.com, GetSatsoshi.org ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  &lt;-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all

- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  &lt;-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Say you want to buy out a vote counter in the system I proposed. You'd have to bribe BOTH counters to be incorrect by the exact same amount and you'd have to bribe the proctors. That's just to alter the subset of votes that are counted by those people in that district. If you wanted to alter all of the district's votes you'd have to bribe EVEN more people. That's for one district. 

To scale this to a state, you'd need to compromise enough districts such that you can offset the margin that your preferred candidate is losing. You also need to spread out your tampering across multiple districts to do this to avoid suspicion. A historically Republican district suddenly flipping to 90% Democrat would raise A LOT of flags. Plus you want to make the overall race close enough that people aren't suspicious about major polling errors, but not so close as to trigger an automatic recount.

Now you have to do all of this compromising across multiple districts likely involving hundreds of people. On top of that they all have to STAY SILENT. If word gets out, the election is investigated and if ballots weren't being directly destroyed they'll just do a recount using the existing paper trail. If the paper ballots no longer exist, they'll just redo the election in the affected districts.

&gt;Like how the bitcoin blockchain works. Decentralised and Immutable.

Blockchain has one big vulnerability, though unlikely. The 51% attack. As I see it there are two main setups for the blockchain network each with their own issues:

- Individuals do the hashing on privately owned machines. (Probably not happening)

  - What's to prevent people with outdated or compromised machines from joining the network? What if someone wrote a piece of malware that forced machines to join the network and wait until they had roughly a majority of the hashing power of the network or until election day before becoming active and disrupting the process? There have been issues with ""legitimate"" desktop and mobile apps running mining software in the background without users realizing and that was just with money on the line. Imagine if an entire government, especially that of one of the most powerful countries, was at stake.

  - You've just limited the number of people you need to compromise from hundreds/thousands to probably just a few dozen administrators. If that. 

Even if you can solve those issues, you need to convince EVERYONE that it's trustworthy.

3957660,3957660,2019-12-10 10:44:17,"Oh hey, it's my most common daydream again!

I'd probably go for it. I don't have a family to support and I don't really have any major attachments that I'd feel too sad about losing. A lot of the things I was into when I was 11 (namely video games), I'm still into today. My family didn't pay too much attention to me and mostly just left me be. It would be fairly easy to have my newfound knowledge and skills fly under the radar.

There's a few things I would most definitely change.

1. I'd do better in school. I was always the bright kid, but I didn't get the support I needed to stay motivated/disciplined. Or to go after something I really wanted. I'd focus way more on math, chemistry and physics in high school so I have more options in college.
2. I would spend a LOT of time drawing and getting better at art. My biggest frustration is having to learn that now in my 30s with so much stress everywhere in my life. Being a perfectionist doesn't help.
3. I basically lived like a hermit in my college days, completely addicted to World of Warcraft with almost zero social life (depression is fun...). This is probably where I'd make the most changes. I'm not exactly sure what major I'd pursue (it sure as hell wouldn't be English a second time), but I would absolutely do so much more with these years that I mostly just wasted.

I'd also get some more time with my best friend and my dad, both of whom passed a few years ago. I'm sure it'd be a weird mindfuck to have them both in my life again, but I'm honestly curious how I'd handle having them 'back' and knowing how they'll end up passing. Knowing there's not really anything I can do to save either of them.

There's also a few things I would manipulate into happening again. Meeting certain friends etc. I'm sure I'll at least consider the oft-mentioned BitCoin or ""invest in Apple"" tactics too, but that's not nearly as important to me to be completely honest.",1

But you say yourself that it's realised positive externalities in the form of chain-level diversification. If we continue to liken cryptonetworks to nations, the ability for people to be able to subdivide and create new places which align better with their values.

As I mentioned in my last comment, I think maximalism has also played an important social role in maintaining the structure of cryptonetworks through the bear markets. It seems to be a sort of group defence mechanism to maintain community unity through difficult times.

I don't think it needs to be as unpleasant as it is in Bitcoin and Ethereum, though. I'm not as familiar with Decred but I get the sense that they have a community code which maintains civility toward other projects, even in the face of difficult times. I don't know how they've achieved that – perhaps it's a by-product of community empowerment – but it might present some solace and suggest that future cryptonetworks can shape culture to initiate a more welcoming and positive tribalness.

There's also the possibility that as cryptonetworks stack up and crypto becomes more established in itself that communities feel less pressure for survival that community members will naturally feel less need for such aggression. I suspect too that crypto is currently full with a certain type of person, much more prone to risk-seeking and aggression, which might get diluted as the technology crosses the chasm.

the US Dollar is 100% oil backed. Forget bonds, Feds and everything you learned school. The only reason the US dollar isn’t worth a penny right now is because Henry Kissinger (Nixon administration) made a deal with the Saudi Royals many decades ago that oil would only be sold for US dollars - in exchange for CIA protection.

USA literally prints TRILLIONS of dollars from thin air- to send to countries that want commodities (oil) and get paid in other currencies, gold, whatever- then turn it around and sell it again for Chinese crap that we don’t need. 

Over the last few years the Venezuelan dollar became worthless from hyperinflation (mostly from losing oil production if you read up on the situation). If you think their hyperinflation is worse than the US, think again.

It's a very lucid and prescient text from 2011. Really good.  

Synopsis:  

&gt; The genius of Bitcoin, in inventing a digital currency successful in the real world, is not in creating any new abstruse mathematics or cryptographic breakthrough, but in putting together decades-old pieces in a semi-novel but extremely unpopular way. Everything Bitcoin needed was available for many years, including the key ideas.  
&gt;
&gt; However, the sacrifice Bitcoin makes to achieve decentralization is—however practical—a profoundly ugly one. Early reactions to Bitcoin by even friendly cryptographers &amp; digital currency enthusiasts were almost uniformly extremely negative, and emphasized the (perceived) inefficiency &amp; (relative to most cryptography) weak security guarantees. Critics let ‘perfect be the enemy of better’ and did not perceive Bitcoin’s potential. However, in an example of ‘Worse is Better’, the ugly inefficient prototype of Bitcoin successfully created a secure decentralized digital currency, which can wait indefinitely for success, and this was enough to eventually lead to adoption, improvement, and growth into a secure global digital currency.",1

Also, with 1/10th of current hash rate Bitcoin would be still an extremely secure protocol. We don't have to always keep the same level of hash rate. As long as there is demand, the more scarce Bitcoin issued will be valuable and also there is already a fee market. It is possible that it becomes unprofitable for some miners and they shut down some part of their equipment, but then difficulty will readjust and this will attract more miners or make them turn on the less efficient equipment again.",1

The uber wealthy don't just have hoards of gold and call it good, they own companies. Every time you spend money, you're cash-flowing someone else's asset. Smart money parks their wealth in productive assets, not in speculative ones. 1 oz of gold will never grow to 2 oz, just as 1 BTC will never grow to 2 BTC. Meanwhile a farm can **produce** a harvest, which can be sold for profit. Sure some farms/companies will fail, which is why diversification of productive assets is key. 

Currently bitcoin is not even close to replacing fiat, it's literally not capable of doing so. And again, it's not a productive asset, so masses won't flood into it even if the network could handle it. Why would you want to own the money when you could own the things that money is used for?

After raid nights when everyone was logging off for the evening, some of these guys would hang around talking about their mining setups, talking about how they left their computer mining overnight and solo mined a block (which would've been 50btc at the time), etc.

At the time I had an awesome gaming rig with a Q6600, one of the first quad-core CPUs, which happened to be perfect for mining bitcoin at the time back when CPU mining was a thing. It was like the perfect conditions were laid out right in front of me.

One night I was listening to them talk about bitcoin and it kind of piqued my interest. I actually asked one of the guys whether he could show me how it works, help me set up a wallet and maybe send me a ""small"" amount of bitcoins (maybe a couple hundred) - but unfortunately he kind of palmed me off because he was too tired to explain it but said I can look it up. After briefly looking into it I thought it seemed complicated, and the thought of leaving my PC loudly running all night kind of deterred me, so I forgot about it.

I often wonder how different my life would have ended up if that guy had just taken the time to help me set up a wallet and show me how it works to get the ball rolling.

Yeah I can imagine pricing is rough for smaller production batches. I was mostly discouraged by the shipping for Switzerland though. It's over half the price of the full kit... and I actually couldn't even test the effective shipping cost calculation at checkout as any real Swiss address I've entered didn't work.

If I could suggest two things:

* Add an option for a ""minimum kit"" with only the plates/encoder (and an optional punch maybe) that you could send in a bubble wrap envelopes to make the shipping costs minimal on those orders. The plates are thin and light, so is the encoder, it should really make a big difference in shipping costs.

If you can't do it with BTCPay Server or want/need to convert to fiat automatically, at least please use ANYTHING ELSE than BitPay as your payment processor... they have the worst user experience for payments of all the processors (unjustified additional ""network"" fees, warning about slow payments even when they confirm in the next block for 1 sat/vbyte, they force the use of a non-standard BIP70 implementation, etc.).

3966769,3966769,2019-12-10 04:33:33,"""Ethereum is far less decentralized than Bitcoin."" 

I don't agree with this especially since it sounds like we're just basing ""decentralization"" on Vitalik being around or not.  

Centralization of hash-power is one of my biggest concerns for a blockchain because it makes the chain very susceptible to a nation state attack. China is pretty hostile toward crypto currency and most hash is in China, I don't see how this glaring centralization security flaw isn't talked about more. At least you can run a PoS validator from anywhere in the world.

Bitmain dominates the hardware supply out of China. Binance w/ Tether dominate the exchange trading volume out of China. Chinese miners dominate BTC hash rate. These are the same powers that are going to try to do everything they can to destroy staking and preserve PoW, mining, and their BTC memes when PoS starts to drop. 

The reality is that neither Bitcoin or Ethereum are that decentralized, but one side likes to pretend it is by spewing bullshit over and over again until it sticks.

3967831,3967831,2019-12-10 05:18:10,"It boils down to a very simple concept.

Let's say you and I will both (metaphorically) fight to the death for Russell's BTCPay cleats. 

- https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/cleats-cause-design-russell-okung-sports-btcpay-server

Let's say I have $100 to my name.  And you have, ...well you have more than $100 of cash and then you have even more resources available to you if whatever cash you have isn't enough.

Which of us gets the cleats?
 
So there's no question as to the outcome. You will get the cleats.  The only question the auction settles is, at what price will you end up paying for them?

It's that way with cash settled futures.  A determined shorter with unlimited money can just drop dollar after dollar after dollar (or billion, after billion, after billion) until the determined longs have run out of funds to continue.

So if 1 future contract is for 1 bitcoin, and it is cash settled, then technically it is possible that a determined shorter can have, at one point in time, open ""short"" positions representing 40 million BTC,   (incidentally, a determined long with unlimited money can have more ""long"" positions than the number of BTC circulating as well).

Now on a physically backed futures market, where 1 position represents 1 BTC, .. what's the maximum open interest (OI) possible?  Well only as many as are held physically by the futures exchange.  So if there's 18M BTC mined to-date, and let's say on some day 10% of them are held by the exchange, then there's a maximum of 1.8M futures contracts that can be traded.  It doesn't matter how much money you have, you cannot be net ""short"" more than 1.8M contracts. 

So, with cash settled, ... a party with unlimited money can be short perhaps 40M BTC (1.0 futures contracts) or more.  There is effectively no upper limit, ... meaning there's an infinite supply of BTC that can be shorted. 

With physically settled, the party with unlimited money can be short a maximum of 1.8M BTC (1.0 futures contracts), and not a single BTC more than that (using the example of 1.8M held physically by the exchange).

Now whether it makes sense for a determined speculator to go short 40M BTC (and I suspect it wouldn't be), that's a whole different argument.",1

I think we saw how close we are in late 2017 when the network's performance degraded *massively* in the face of a surge in transactional demand.  And that surge was still *incredibly* tiny relative to the potential demand that could exist one day if we imagine a future of mass global adoption. 

&gt;In fact, even if we keep the current blocksize, BTC will work just fine as a SoV forever

Sorry, but that's absurd. Again, with a current transactional capacity of around 500,000 tx / day, it would take the world's 7.7 billion people a little over *42 years* to make a single transaction each (not that the vast majority could afford to do so in this scenario).  

&gt;Especially with the flourishing of L2 solutions that you will dismiss.

Yes, I do dismiss them. For good reason. As I explained in a previous reply to you:

""L2 options"" such as the LN don't begin to solve BTC's problems. The LN is best characterized as a form of ""semi-custodial banking.""  It's a necessarily-imperfect substitute for the actual Bitcoin network, and one with an inherent tendency towards massive centralization. Moreover, it *becomes* an even *more* imperfect substitute--and its incentives towards massive centralization become progressively *stronger*--as on-chain fees rise. The idea that it represents any kind of meaningful ""scaling solution"" for Bitcoin is a complete farce.  Expanded explanation [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/beypf7/interview_with_peter_rizuns_critiquing_the/elcm0ix/). 

And Lightning's problems in this regard are not unique to that network's particular design.  *Any* time you attempt to move Bitcoin-denominated transactions onto a “second-layer” I think you’ll discover that what you’ve done is add a layer of risk. And further that the risk you’ve added increases the more the underlying blockchain is constrained relative to the layers operating on top of it. Because what you’re essentially doing is building this inverted pyramid. And the smaller the ""base"" is relative to the structures built on top, the more precarious the whole thing becomes.",1

3979231,3979231,2019-12-10 08:45:42,"Well first of all SEED and Bitcoin are two completely different cryptocurrencies, you cant compare the two.

SEED is a reward token that is backed by TRX, ONT and ONG. SEED can only be issued whenever a blockchain gives out their rewards. For example, Sesameseed runs a node on Tron and Ontology and when users stake/vote for Sesameseed and earn their staking rewards, they give SEED instead and Sesameseed stores the TRX, ONG and ONT, which revotes/stakes and automatically compounds for you, so your SEED earn more SEED.

I will admit that it is kinda a complex system. But once understood it all makes sense and is a very unique model for staking.

I wont go into all the benefits, as there is a lot to talk about, but the easiet way to learn is join their telegram room and ask questions, everyone is helpful and friendly.

Now take a larger view of gold, in the same way you say 'but we're burning oil every day, there's less in our bank every day, this is dumb!'--take a century long view look at gold (or any other physical material, it truly doesn't matter). 

There's a finite amount of gold on earth, AND it has uses besides being hypothetical money (and looking pretty!), right? Finite amount of oil, finite amount of gold. 

AND you are sending out gold every day for manufacturing purposes, and for sure not getting all of that back even with heavy recycling efforts, I promise, [you're not getting it all](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/precious-poop-scientists-mine-human-feces-valuable-metals-and-rare-elements/).

Real question, gold standard alternate universe, now that you came this far with me, have some fun:

If Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk or Kim Un could use their rocket programs to capture an asteroid that contained approximately 14% of the world's current gold quantity (literally all the gold that every human has ever mined in all of human history combined)--do you think we should just crown them Lord and get it over with? Which would you bet on in this version of Wacky Races?

More serious finishing questions: The elites of the world say money is now based on a pile of a thing again. They control what the thing is, what it is worth, who counts it and who can even come and go from pile counting.

If they don't, always withdraw larger fiat money sums progressively from exchanges over days/weeks/months, not all at once. If you have to do it very regularly you might still trigger the same procedures though at some point... and there's no way around this thanks to KYM/AML/bank compliance departments.

But hey, it could be even worse, it could mean your exchange is running out of fiat liquidity at the time which isn't a very healthy situation if they cannot fix it very quickly :S",1

Title: **Is there a legal risk for this business opportunity?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I got contacted by someone in Africa who sells puppies to the US. He’s having me run his online marketing. So far, his customers send me money through Zelle and that money covers my management fee and his ad spend. Once I get money through Zelle, he sends them the puppy. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is this first part of the business opportunity legal? 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, he’s asking that I receive larger Zelle amounts from his customers and then transfer the money as Bitcoin through Cash App to him while taking a percentage fee for myself. I would receive money from his customer through Zelle and then send it to him via Cash App. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is this part of the business opportunity legal? 
&gt; 
&gt; I want to make sure that as a US citizen, I’m not at any risk of getting involved in an illegal operation that could put me or my LLC at risk.

&gt; The channels don't exist beforehand. A LN channel is an on chain transaction (2 of 2 multi sig) that you must pay for, unless someone opens one towards you. 

I understand all this. What I am saying is that there are services that will charge you to open a channel to you. I could only find 1 that did not charge. 

&gt; That isn't liquidity though, you require incoming capacity.

Ok, whatever. Terminology. People were calling this liquidity but I can go with capacity if you prefer. 

&gt; No. You learn how the LN works.

So if I don't have a watchtower and i'm not running a node is my money safe?

&gt; You're implying that though, which is false.

No. Whenever there is a complaint about LN we're told it's not ready. It has however also been shown that LN doesn't scale and therefore will likely never be ready. 

You can apply the beta tag all you want be we've had bitcoin for 10 years now. Maybe you're going with Google's definition of beta. 

&gt; If all Bitcoin transactions were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to 
enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the 
channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 
blocks per year).

&gt; \- Author: Joseph Poon

Now tell me that the author of the LN whitepaper did not say it would need 133MB blocks.

4004777,4004777,2019-12-10 20:31:23,"&gt; But it looks like you are applying some economics concepts to bitcoin and treating it as a commodity or purely its currency properties while omitting the digital gold concept.

Again, I think the entire value proposition of Bitcoin was rendering obsolete the historical distinction between a scarce-but-hard-to-transact ""store of value"" like gold and a non-scarce-but-easy-to-transact ""medium of exchange"" like paper or electronic fiat. *That* to me is the significance of the phrase ""digital gold,"" i.e., combining gold-like scarcity with the transactional convenience of a digital medium.  A Bitcoin with crippled capacity is actually *worse* than gold.  Gold does have relatively high transactional friction (in per-transaction terms), but at least that friction doesn't increase dramatically the more people begin to accept and use gold.  

&gt;In relation to L2 options, these will flourish over the next few years and I think you have dismissed them too quickly. 

I don't think my dismissal was particularly quick at all. I think it was a pretty thoughtful and well-reasoned analysis. No offense, but it seems to me that *you're* the one who's guilty of dismissing an argument too quickly by failing to meaningfully engage with it.  

&gt;Centralisation is fine for LN. It still works.

Sorry, but that's insane.  First of all, with BTC's current capacity, in a hypothetical global adoption scenario, most people wouldn't be able to afford to use even a *completely* centralized LN by opening a single channel with the one Super-Mega-Hub that all other users would connect to (remember: 42 years).  The real minimum number of channels is not one, it's zero.  Most users would opt for a far, far cheaper and infinitely-easier-to-use fully-custodial alternative in this scenario.  And even if you are one of the lucky few who can afford to open a channel and maintain it, centralization would not be ""fine.""  The entire purpose of Bitcoin was to remove the need for trusted intermediaries by decentralizing power over the operation of money!",1

To achieve this, the network automatically takes the average in which the block had been mined, and if it was below/above the 10 minute, it will increase the dificulty.     


Now, in the beginning, you could mine bitcoin with your CPU power (what today will be a strong smartphone). But as more competitors joined the game, the dificulty adjusted. Today, the only profitable way to mine bitcoin is with ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit) machines that are made to do one and only one thing : the hash function SHA-256.   

These machines are very expensive and keep getting better and better, using as little electricity as they can to produce the most hashes per second they can.    

Obviously, people that don't understand the implications of the Bitcoin protocol and blockchain will complain that people are using electricity to resolve stupid puzzles, when in reality, it's about the revolution of money and human organization.

Jeg står så heldigvis i den situation at jeg investerede med det formål at det skulle være i en altcoin med lav marketcap, og vekslede umiddelbart de købte bitcoin til altcoinen med det samme og har holdt den samme coin lige siden, så der vil umiddelbart ikke have været nogen gevinst eller tab på bytte tidspunktet.",1

Whereas here in Ethereum we have tons of technical process and discussion and news but nobdody talk about the poor performance from ethereum as a token and the reason behind it which is too high supply vs low demand. 

So clearly token economics does not work out for the coin holders ?

Other chains paying 20 000 usd a day and have 99% less selling pressure thus doing same performance than Eth even they have 99% less transactions. 

Maybe we should cut it to half so we pay 1 million a day like in janaury 2019

A wallet has thousands of keys  

Bitcoin is a public database of transactions. Nearly 100,000 volunteers keep a copy of the database on the Internet all the time  
Every transaction has inputs and outputs. Your money is stored on the outputs of transactions which were sent to your addresses. An output has an address and amount. An output is known as a ""coin"". You can spend any coin which has one of your addresses on it. A coin can only be spent once  

Your software wallet is a collection of private keys. Every key has an address - address is derived from public key  

Bitcoin uses asymmetric cryptography signatures to control the right to spend coins. When you send a coin to someone else, you use your private key to sign the transaction. The transaction is then sent to the Bitcoin network and added to a block of transactions to be included in the public database. All the volunteer computers which keep a copy of the database then check that your signature matches your public key and that your public key matches your address

Some of these platforms are exposed to price swings in crypto assets but are not fully backed by the corresponding assets. A sustained upward price movement puts them in a difficult situation where their reserves are underfunded. *Hopefully everyone can see they have a vested interest in dampening rapid upward price movement.* 

There needs to be clear advantages to on-chain bitcoin compared to paper bitcoin for this to change meaningfully. Right now for many investors paper bitcoin are superior. These platforms are FDIC insured, strongly mitigate counter party risk, offer dependable liquidity and abstract away custody of the assets, things that big players value greatly. Deeper integration of on-chain btc into emerging DeFi applications would certainly help close the gap but it's hard to see how the 21M cap can be anything but a marketing ploy these days.

That means Bitcoin could only work as alternative replacement global currency if miners become large operations. And that means large companies down the road, ones in the hands of capitalist entities, who may well eventually be able to control the Bitcoin market. Over 95 percent of all Bitcoin in circulation are owned by around four percent of the market, and one percent owns half of the market. Also, if Bitcoin were to become a viable means to pay taxes to government, it would then require some form of price relationship with the existing fiat money supply. So governments will still be there.

There are other possibilities of even more mega-corporate power in the dystopian future that is fast arriving such as through Facebook's ""Libra"" currency, which despite Facebook's claim that its new crypto-currency is ""decentralized,"" relies on an utterly unaccountable and highly-centralized operating structure in the form of a global corporation. Cash use is being increasingly restricted, and we're already reliant on a handful of big banks to manage our money and make payments, while Visa and Mastercard have achieved almost total dominance of the credit card market. Libra is really a corporate attempt to assert even greater control over our money.

What we really need is democratic control of financial institutions and the takeover of mega-tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Governments should then use technological innovation to develop an international digital currency controlled and run in the public interest.

4099774,4099774,2019-12-10 15:00:05,"Sure I have no problem being honest. So let me give you a little background.

My thoughts/opinions/interests in Bitcoin go back to early 2011. I got wind of Bitcoin on a Slashdot thread sometime in 2010 and quickly dismissed it as another failed cyber-money attempt. Then in 2011 when I saw it was actually still alive and growing, I decided to take a moment and read the white paper. What I read was astounding, as in this *seemed* like something that could actually work. After re-reading it a few times I was convinced. So I bought some GPU cards (yes this was in the days of GPU mining) and started mining.

Since that time I've read every article, blog post, video, interview, etc. around Bitcoin I could find. All the good, all the bad, all the in between. The signal-to-noise ratio of valid information has steadily grown worse over time. I did understand from a very early stage that Blockstream was a bad actor, and the moment the BCH fork happened I was all-in. It was a gut-wrenching decision at the time but I knew it was right. Then later came the culmination of the first hash war, and again I took the road less-taken, all in accordance with evidence and information gathered from the earliest days of Bitcoin. The dis-information today is absolutely astounding. A new comer would have a terrible time with it.

You may not agree with me and that is fine, because in the long run it won't matter what you or I think or what this subreddit thinks, no one will remember or care. If you look at the tech, you should see how BSV is growing. Growing in adoption, in development platforms, in transaction volume and block size. Soon enough price will follow utility. The other alts are largely based on speculation, BSV is the one based on utility, the one that is the original Bitcoin and scaling on the original protocol. You can dismiss it and throw excuses, it won't matter. I think in a couple years time enough information will be out to provide the truth beyond reasonable doubt, and the general public will have no recollection of the trials and tribulations gone through to get there.",1

There's no technical details that you have to understand, no arcane dangers that you have to be worried about, no zero-day exploit websites that you have to obsessively monitor. Bitcoin just doesn't have that. 

(There are people who claim to use Bitcoin for regular transactions but pretty much all of those people are hardcore Bitcoin evangelists who by definition are comfortable with it as a currency. They can't move the needle for regular people because regular people can't relate to them.)

4106974,4106974,2019-12-10 18:58:28,"The algorithm is designed such that no matter how much computational power is being used to mine cryptocurrency, it will always produce a set amount of cryptocurrency within a given timeframe. This is by making the ""solution"" computationally harder to find. So, as more people mine with better hardware using more electricity, fewer coins are produced per watt of energy being funneled into the system. This is a small reason on why the price of bitcoin kept rising for the past 10 years (a smaller reason than speculation, though). For mining to be profitable, the value of one coin must be more than the electricity it takes to produce that one coin.

Over the past 10 years, the value of one bitcoin has gone from less than a cent up to the all time high of 22,000 USD. Thats over a 2.2 million times increase in the amount of value, and therefore electrical power used to mine the coin over the whole network can be expanded to roughly 2.2million times the number calculations per second while still remaining profitable.

The main takeaway though, is that by ""spending"" electricity, one can turn a profit by mining bitcoins. So they do. And more people do as well. It's a feedback loop that will continually demand more and more electricity, so long as bitcoin (and other proof of work currencies) have rising demand.

If the price of bitcoin dropped sharply, for most it is no longer profitable to mine it, so they wont, which makes each other person mining get a little bit more efficiency as they're competing with fewer miners.",1

No they are not, they may cherry-pick one or two applications as a pilot, but they'll switch the underlying technology in a heatbeat if desirable. I work in the industry, have personally been involved in several blockchain PoCs on the side of the customer.

&gt; When cardano finally is able to handle smart contracts, what is going to make everyone switch from the current standard to whatever standard cardano is using? 

Ability to formally verify the code; chain interoperability.

&gt; In addition, as stated before, what works well on paper rarely works well in practice. 

That's why you have a academic paper, and Engineering / Functional specification derived from that paper later on. Papers make assumptions, functional specifications set them in context, and use engineering principles to align the overall codebase to the limits of real world.

&gt; Even if the academic papers sounds good, who is going to want to risk building financial applications on a network that hasn't been tried and tested.

You obviously don't have a clue what kind of testing we as a community do (I am not associated with any of EMURGO/CF/IOHK).

&gt; most smart contract platforms run into major issues that no one thought of after they are released, once the public has the chance to test it out.

It just doesn't work.  It'll take a little while to get it if you're new but you'll see this is a great technology 

Even if bitcoin goes to 1 million a coin and a satoshi is 1 penny, a 0 conf will cost over a dollar probably a few dollars for a 1 sat/byte.  Lightning scales because it can transfer msats 1/1000 a satoshi and have routing fees set at fractions of a satoshi 

This divisiability would allow payments for beer by the ml or streaming by the second its vastly superior than an on chain and at the end if the day it all settles on main chain anyways",1

Actually that recovery password works without the ledger software. You plug the 23 words into a algorithm and it spits out the private keys. That is why anyone could steal your Bitcoin id they have that 23 word recovery phrase. The ledger software has the algorithm built in to recover a wallet, but I could use the same recovery phrase in most modern wallets. 

Here is a article explain how that works. I could be a bit off as I am not an encryption expert. [https://privatekeys.org/2017/09/12/key-derivation-in-bitcoin-wallets-as-defined-in-bip-0032/](https://privatekeys.org/2017/09/12/key-derivation-in-bitcoin-wallets-as-defined-in-bip-0032/)",1

4129392,4129392,2019-12-10 22:45:14,"There are many videos on this you should check out. Simple explanation

1. Private keys are used to generate public keys
2. Bitcoin is stored in public keys
3. If you can sign transaction with your private key it can be shown you own the public key
4. You send a signal to the network to move Bitcoin from your public key to another public key, signing the request with your private key
5. Miners verify that you are the owner, and add you to block. They can see the message was signed with the same private key that created the public key that currently has the BTC. 
6. Once other people verify the miners  block meets the rules of bitcoin the block is validated. These rules include that only the owner of the private key can move the BTC in the public adress.
7. After enough validations of a block people will trust the Bitcoin has changed addresses by the owner of the private key.

It would be good to look up encryption in general to understand the process. This is the same way passwords are verified on computers without being able to see what the password is",1

&gt;     It is notable that Greg Maxwell is a heavy contributor to Elements and has been for a long time,

&gt;I don't have any ongoing involvement in elements, and the only thing that I personally wrote that was implemented in it was confidential transactions. Confidential transactions is also a part of many other things. So because I did one thing four years ago, you're now saying ""heavy contributor to Elements and has been for a long time""? I have no involvement with it now, and haven't for years.

Your overreaction is pretty interesting, why is this such a sore subject for you? You are acting like I accused you of being a terrorist and I am baffled by this.

You started Elements and co-founded its parent company, that counts as ""heavily contributed"" to its existence and mission to establish federated sidechains, which you also pushed through several contentious changes to the Bitcoin Core protocol itself in preparation for products like Liquid, all of which managed by Blockstream exclusively.  

https://web.archive.org/web/20151102065011/https://github.com/ElementsProject/elementsproject.github.io

&gt;What would you say if I had alleged ""It is notable that Roger Ver is a heavy advocate of MTGox and has been for a long time""?
&gt;MTGox was insolvent since late 2011. Roger's public testimonial that there wasn't a lack of liquidity was false when he made it in 2013.

I would say I don't really care about your straw men, what does Roger Ver have to do with your involvement with Elements?

&gt;I have no idea what you're asserting. A proof is a proof, it's either sound or it's busted. What specifically are you claiming is unsound? As far as I can tell you're just slinging FUD. That chain itself can only prove assets, it can't show anything about liabilities. Any protocol to prove solvency has to incorporate both parts.

With other books when you deposit with BTC they convert it to dollars(Or whatever your local currency is) at the current BTC market rate.   So your bankroll on Nitrogen is subject to BTC market value swings.  I had a winning record while using Nitrogen but the BTC market dropped pretty badly and my bankroll ended up being worth less than my initial deposit despite a winning record. Its hard enough beating a book but you are also at the total will of the BTC market also which is totally out of your hands.  Of course this can also work in your favor if the market happens to surge.  But thats an added factor of risk I just didnt care for.  

My second biggest gripe was live betting is extremely limited on Nitrogen.  Very little options for live bets.   

Lastly, again, the entire site is based off bitcoin.  So all wagers are placed and payed in BTC.  So you will need to use a bitcoin converter app to calculate the appropriate value in your local currency so you know exactly how much BTC to wager.  Again the value of BTC fluctuates moment to moment.

There's a lot of subjectivity in deciding 1) how centralizing each element is as compared to other very different elements 2) what degree of centralization is bad 3) how to weigh the specific benefits of each element against how centralizing it is

Personally, I'd say Ethereum is far less decentralized than Bitcoin.  I own a lot of eth, almost no bitcoin, so obviously I don't consider that an insult.  There are tradeoffs you have to make.  Having a visible, highly involved founder is a big point of centralization, but it also permits faster development.

Personally, I don't want fast and frequent development on Bitcoin (anymore), and someday I do plan to own more bitcoin (my not owning much now is a relative valuation issue, not a dislike of the asset).  While not having substantial development on Ethereum would be far more problematic, at least for now.

4140680,4140680,2019-12-10 00:32:22,"There isn't much to worry about.

The banks are already in on ""crypto"" because they've all took the kool aid. Every bank is already developing their own permissioned blockchains to ride the hype.

Ultimately, no bank is going to trust the blockchain or token of another bank, because they know from their own project that ""blockchain"" is a scam designed to enrich its developer. As a result, the banks are going to have to settle on an asset which is beyond any of them to control, and when they weigh up their options they'll conclude that Bitcoin is the most suitable.

Banks will use Bitcoin between themselves, but they will offer their clients an alternative ""blockchain"" solution. They will realize soon afterwards that it isn't particularly easy to get adoption, even if they pay for it and invest massively in marketing. They'll be competing for adoption with every other banks, and none of them will be able to gain a critical mass.

Meanwhile, payments over the Lightning network will become commonplace. The banks will have no choice but to concede defeat and instead offer custodial lightning network accounts to their clients, but will likely still use ""blockchain"" as a marketing term to refer to their in-house databases which interoperate with LN.

Banks aren't going to disappear. They'll change form. They'll have the same problem that newspapers and record labels have faced with the internet. If they can't adapt to the technology quick enough they'll be crushed. Their ""intranets of money"" aren't going to work.

Most users of LN will be using custodial wallets. It's not ideal, but there isn't much we can really do about that. Most users will not care about ""no keys no coins"", nor take the time to learn how the technology works and run their own node. They'll get a Lightning Network app from their bank, who has custody over their ""bitcoin"", which they can use to trade. The only time they'll be concerned is if the bank's liabilities greatly exceed its assets, causing a bank run.

Bitcoin is going to force the banks to become more honest and more risk-averse. The banks aren't going to be able to print infinite money anymore, and they're not going to hand out bad loans with the expectation that a lender of last resort will bail them out. They're going to face a lot of new competition, and they're not necessarily going to be able to run to the State and demand regulatory capture to block their competition.",1

Enigma and Chainlink announced a new collaboration, focusing on the integration of their protocols to enable powerful new use cases for secret smart contracts. Integrating Enigma’s and Chainlink’s protocols can have both near-term and longer-term benefits for developers and users. More complex integrations can maximize the combined and independent power of Enigma’s secure computation protocol and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network. One such integration is the use of Chainlink nodes to submit oracle data as tasks to Secret Contracts. Application developers will be able to use APIs available via Chainlink to trigger events in their contracts.

Ampleforth, a commodity-money, like Bitcoin or gold, but with near-perfect supply elasticity, like fiat, will be the first monetary asset to use Chainlink oracles to aggregate secure and timely off-chain pricing data for its protocol. Through the Chainlink integration, Ampleforth’s Market Oracle (volume-weighted price) and CPI Oracle (current price target) will be powered by nine different incoming price feeds from three different aggregators, which act together to determine the magnitude of AMPL’s supply adjustment every 24 hours.

4163958,4163958,2019-12-10 16:06:12,"Mining is one of the fundamental consensus protocols used in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. In conjunction with other technologies like Asymmetric cryptography, digital signing schemes and a P2P network, it ensures transactions will be legitimate.   

You broadcast a transaction in the Bitcoin network (Capital B, bitcoin is the coin) that's signed using the ECDSA(Eliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm), ensuring that the transaction can be verified by anyone who knows your public key, given that you signed it with your private key that only you know. Now, the miners have to construct a ""block"" of information which contains all the transactions they received in the last moments, to a certain block space (block size). When they are done, they must hash the block plus the hash of the previous block(1) verified in the network, plus a nonce (number used once). The hash, converted to a hexadecimal value, must be lower than the target value of the network (i.e. ""The difficulty""), in order for the other miners to verify it and agree that the block is indeed legitimate. This action is what's called the Proof-of-Work (PoW), because it takes computational work to try over and over again with a different nonce to find a value below the target value. That translates in energy, which translates in money, which is ultimately, work.  

When the block is created, the miner who found the block can adjudicate himself the block reward, which is in the form of a coin, in the case of the Bitcoin network, a bitcoin. That's the only moment in which bitcoins appear into existence. This system is made so that it ensures the legitimacy of the network and its transactions, encouraging miners to be honest in order for them to receive the incentives.    

(1) A hash comes from a cryptographic function which receives and input of any size, and returns a string with a determined lenght. It's used to ""hide"" information, because creating a hash is very easy, but returning the original value from the hash, is computationally infeasible.   

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. There's,obviously, a lot more to it, but I've explained the fundamentals so far.",1

Other than that, it's interesting to see progress in this domain.

It absolutely is the case that a lack of funding contributes to slow development of this sort of thing.  There are many advantages of massive premines, just as there are many advantages to other forms of ripping people off... I'm still happy that Bitcoin hasn't engaged in that sort of activity.

Bitcoin and national currencies have to be centralized, architecture-wise, so that they are actually currencies.  You need to control the generation and allocation of a currency for it to have any sort of reliability, which means some central database to keep track of how much there is and who gets it.

What Bitcoin is, different from national currencies, is global and open/public, so that anyone who wants to get involved, can, as long as they have the resources (computers, internet, skills) to do so.

Also, almost all currencies these days are distributed, so that there is no ""central point of failure"".  No nation or even most cryptocurrencies are only on one computer or are generated/allocated from any single physical location.",0

Let me be honest: The more I get into this topic of the confrontation between a group of you guys with cryptacritic, the more I lose respect of a lot of people here who were involved.

You guys couldn´t handle a 20 year old who has been spoon fed by cryptorebel and his buddies with his religious BSV crap for a couple of weeks. Brilliant. 

I had some private chats with cryptorebel, that guy feeds you with honey flavoured distractions to get you over to his side. I am not at all surprised that someone who is just out of his teenage years doesn´t see how he is being brainwashed.

Now that he changed his mind and wants to be integrated again here in this community, a bunch of you actually has nothing better to do than to hunt him through the sub, embarrass him with comments and posts and threads? wtf....

And then there is this weird ""fan post"" from a user he banned afterwards because that post **links to all his other social media accounts that reveal his real identity**. And you guys spread that post further and take it as proof that he is a troll... Do you even ever question things you see?

I see that the first ones of you are going over to his sub now [to troll it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCashBCH/comments/e8v2jt/this_subreddit_appears_to_be_an_antibch_site_run/). I don´t see cryptorebel trolling it though....

Seriously, I have been fighting for BCH here in this sub for 2 years now, always against outsiders. Just a few weeks ago all these weird users start popping up that Ive never noticed before, playing troll hunting, spamming this sub with conspiracy theories about the new social attack vectors. But actually you guys are the ones stressing me out. And I am getting sick of these off topic drifts that you guys cause in every fucking comment section.

You start to behave the same way that the Bitcoin maxis did, witch hunting for everyone who is not aligning with the BCH is the best narrative, and distracting from actual discussions.

For one you often have to trust 3rd parties with Bitcoin, you have to trust 3rd parties when you buy Bitcoin off an exchange (which goes wrong all the time) and have to trust that when you send 3rd parties Bitcoin they'll actually deliver on your agreement. But also most people don't care about trusting 3rd parties as long as the 3rd parties are reliable and give you a good end product. People would rather trust banks then have a situation with Bitcoin where if you fudge the address you just send money into the ether and there's no recourse if you get hacked. I really don't see why many people would consider the lack of 3rd parties so important they'd be willing to take on the numerous downsides associated with Bitcoin.

Edit: Also even if Bitcoin was a bit better I still think it's crazy to think that it'll lead to the collapse of the banking system in our lifetime. For one the banks would probably adopt to Bitcoin if it was really a thread but banks have so much institutional momentum it'd be hard to kill them off.

Q is always 10steps ahead because the steps are already fixed, like an actor in a movie everyone knows their place. MSM is controlled so we ""see"" these people go to trial, we ""see"" these people go to ""jail"" but they are in special jails us regular folk aren't allowed, so are they really there? The person that half the country hates and thought was inept was secretly the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind because he ""saved"" us and he drained the global swap. He/Q says they did it for us because they care and that we don't owe them anything. The guys just saved the human race...we owe them big even if they say we don't, we feel it. How can we repay someone that doesn't need money? You just follow, you obey, you look the other way and you accept every change from this new group because they obviously know whats good for mankind. Now that we are a global humanity that is connected through this great awakening it only makes sens to have a global currency that transcends borders...after all USD/FIAT is one of the reason were were in that mess to begin with. So in comes Bitcoin that has no borders and can be transferred to anyone.

The great depression was caused by one thing only, congress having passed it's constitutionally endowed charge of managing the currency onto the Federal Reserve who failed, it is unlikely the Federal Reserve will allow the supply of money to fall by 1/3rd again (had they not allowed that to happen it would have just been a regular recession), they'll find some other way to screw up everything in the future.  Additionally, government action prolonged the great depression, by the time the market was recovering and unemployment was reasonably under double digits, between good old Hoover's well intentioned tariffs, and shortly thereafter was then further prolonged by FDR when he instituted a series of social programs which together raised unemployment into double digits for the rest of the depression era, until the war saved us from the depression, by removing much of the labor force competition by recruitment for the war effort and the rest of the world's productive capabilities were diminished thereafter and the depression just went away.

The US is a sovereign nation and prints it's own currency and so fundamentally cannot default on it's debt, it can just print up more cash. The biggest holder of US government debt are people in the US, and government debt doesn't work the same way as household debt, it is necessary for the government to take on debt to spend because the large infrastructure things the government typically is charge with demand it, government spending is an important part of any economy.  The debt is also irrelevant, the US government wields the largest taxing authority on the planet, and has assets and operate a GDP well in excess of the nominal debt also making it meaningless.

So what part of government debt being a thing would be something that stops you from investing?  What is the alternative?  Having a bunch of cash, USD, there is this thing called ""inflation"" so you're taking a \~-3% loss year over year guaranteed (unless you're lucky and can hold a 0% interest debt, then it is helping you that same amount).  That said, the returns on cash are not good (unless there is a deflation/depression, which like I said is unlikely), though it is low risk, therefore invest across assets.

Look into an all weather portfolio as there are really only a few worthwhile asset classes to invest in, and maybe mix in an allocation to bitcoin.  Adjusted for leverage, all asset classes happen to have very similar returns, and only materially differ in risk, so don't be afraid of things like gold.

Every asset class has some kind of benefit in a portfolio (besides the obvious benefits of having either positive or negative or non correlation), bonds (TLT, IEF) are low volatility, low risk, provide predictable cash flow in the form of interest, and with the ability to now have interest rates go negative the returns are potentially pretty fair (bond price and yield are two different sides of the same coin).  Equity, should you buy the whole market through something like VT (or VOO), you benefit from all the goodwill of the underlying companies, as well as all the dividends, buybacks, leverage, and buyouts all the underlying companies do.  Gold (IAU) there is no company underneath to go bankrupt, nor can the supply meaningfully increase (similar argument for bitcoin).  Commodities (DBC) however should have negative real returns in good times, because normally as USD goes up against a basket of currencies, commodities go down, bond yields track commodity prices down which causes bond prices to go up, which cause equities to rise, therefore conversely, if the currency drops, commodities will spike as the rest of the portfolio tanks so it is prudent to still hedge yourself with them (but maybe hedge that position with a USD forex tracking ETF like UUP until shtf).

Then get a brokerage account, most of them are now commission finally so maybe use TD ameritrade, Schwab, Robinhood, M1finance, ect.",0

If there are shared rules, that all must obey, or be kicked out of the system, as in Bitcoin, then it's centralized, literally central rules.  All democracies and meritocracies and authoritarian systems are centralized.

A decentralized system is one in which everyone has different rules, but they are all still connected in some way.  Like how art is.  Art doesn't require anyone to do anything specific, and there are no general rules that all artists follow, yet art is still a system, which we can generally describe as a single thing (i.e., ""art"").

Some folks like to call Bitcoin ""decentralized"" but it isn't, logically, since there is literally a central ledger and software that all must use.  What Bitcoin is, as compared to national currencies, is fully public, open source, and global.  Anyone who has the resources can run a node, mine, buy and use Bitcoin, and even help develop it.

The exodus of the retail market with dilution of remaining attention over the proliferation of projects that occured over the last bull has created a community of mostly bagholders some of whom will psychologically resort to maximalist tendencies to mentally shield themselves and justify their investments.

Furthermore to reference nationalism there is a real difference between prideful about your communities achievements and being xenophobic which is the closest analogy to maximalism.

The former gives your community morale to sustain it. The latter can be used to waste money and years building pointless walls that people are gonna scale in minutes anyway.

I used to feel a part of the Ethereum community but my own experiences of maximalism in it have served to drive me away from the project and away from engaging in dialogue with it, not towards it.

This is also born out in Bitcoin; look at the fork. Even the history of Ethereum is in part due to VBs perceived resistance from BTC maximalism.

4186378,4186378,2019-12-10 23:27:24,"&gt;And you don't think that the entire platform being built on the XRP ledger is bullish for XRP at all?

No.

&gt;The fact that they plan on using the DEX of the XRP ledger?

As I said, that's bullish for XRPL, but neutral (at best) for XRP.

&gt;Traditional assets being tokenized on the XRP ledger and the assets being tradable and redeemable against XRP and SOLO is not bullish for XRP at all?

No, because there's no incentive to use XRP. They've made their own coin and given it incentives to be used.

&gt;The fact that they even decided to build on the XRP ledger is bullish to me, it speaks to the tech being the best option to do so.

Yes, as I've repeatedly said, and you've not seemed to grasp: bullish for the XRPL.

&gt;Why didn't they go build it on the Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchain?

Because it's not as good as the XRPL for what they're trying to do.

&gt;In their own words from the whitepaper you skimmed over and didn't read through...

Yeah, see how it says ""XRP ledger"" and ""XRP blockchain"" there?

&gt;Like this won't do anything to positively contribute to the XRP ecosystem and drive value to XRP just like all those Dapps and ERC20 tokens built on Ethereum didn't drive any value to Ethereum /s.

Because the DEX in XRPL only requires very very tiny amounts of XRP to use it. You can fund your account with 20 XRP since transactions cost 10 drops, with that amount of XRP you can carry out 2 million transactions before you need to consume/buy any more XRP.

1 new IOU coin on the XRPL is hardly equivalent to the 208,165 ERC-20 tokens that exist.

&gt;I don't know, of course we can respectfully disagree here but I am flabbergasted that someone could read that whitepaper (I know you didn't read it but still) and determine that Solgenic is not even in the slightest bit bullish for XRP at all.

Because I am able to comprehend when things are good for the underlying platform vs good for the native asset on that platform.

People spamming BTC IOUs on XRPL isn't helpful for XRP either. This is no different.

At worst this is actively bad for XRP because it is chewing up the limited \~1,500TPS that the XRPL can handle. The more transactions involving SOLO there are, the fewer transactions involving XRP there'll be, once the transaction cap is reached. This will in turn push up transaction fees for everyone, even people who have no interest in SOLO whatsoever, they will be charged higher fees because SOLO is taking up capacity on the XRPL.

&gt;It's all about interoperability amongst all assets and currencies and not forcing people to use just one asset like XRP.

I'm not sure if you noticed, but XRP is trying to be a bridge currency for other coins and fiat currencies. SOLO isn't using XRP as a bridge.

Maybe SOLO will be the start of lots of companies starting projects on the XRPL, and some of those projects will directly engage with XRP and bring value to it (which SOLO doesn't). Maybe it's just the start of companies bringing projects to XRPL where they are all IOUs that don't directly interact with XRP, but through the weight of their use cases can have a halo effect on XRP and drive value to it. But that's ***future*** and *speculative*, not what sologenic are doing today, now, with their project, which is not bullish for XRP.",0
