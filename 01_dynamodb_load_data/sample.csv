2019-12-31 19:31:09,"""Roth IRA"" is not an investment.  It's an account type.   Take a few steps back.  Ignoring all the modern accounts, how would you invest money ""back in the day""? You would walk up to a company and say ""excuse me, I would like to buy a share of stock please.""  Then you pay them, they give you paper, and that's that.  Now, that isn't efficient if you want to buy/sell quickly.  Modern companies also don't want to bother with individual investors buying one share at a time - it costs too much to do business that way.  Instead, there are professionals who sit between investors and shares.  These are [broker/dealers](  They use technology to make the process more efficient, so now you can go online and buy a share.  They hold the share for you.  This phase brings us to the Fidelity's, TD Ameritrade's, Robin Hood's of the world.  These are just regular accounts.   Some broker/dealers specialize in a certain kind of security, and some choose to make people get different accounts for different investment types.  For example, in some broker/dealers you can only hold stock and bond investments in a brokerage account; and hold mutual funds only in a mutual fund account.  This all depends on how their internal systems are set up.   Along the way, the government realizes that it makes sense to incentivize people to save for retirement.  The government is willing to give you *tax breaks*, with limits, each year to invest for your retirement.  These tax breaks are tracked through different account types, but are still administered by broker/dealers.  This includes IRAs, 401(k), 403(b), and a bunch more.  The government also said that they're fine with two types of tax benefit: no taxes now, pay taxes later (Traditional); and taxes now, no taxes later (Roth).  So you can have a Traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, a Traditional 401(k), etc.  So when you say ""should I invest in a Roth IRA"" - that question doesn't really make sense since it's an account type, not an investment.  If you have a Roth IRA available to you, it's a great account type to use because growth is tax free, and you can take *contributions* (but not growth) out tax free any time without penalty, if you need to.   Once your money is in a Roth IRA account, you still need to decide what to invest in.  You could invest in bitcoin, penny stocks, blue chip stocks, index funds, ETFs, this list could go on for days.  Think through your requirements for money going forward.  The [RRTTLLU framework]( can be helpful.  If you need the money in the very near future, you will want to stick to savings accounts, CDs, and money market mutual funds.  If you have a longer time horizon, you can split the money between bond index funds (short- to medium-term needs) and equity index funds (medium- to longer-term needs).  You can either pick the individual funds, or you can choose something like [a vanguard target retirement fund]( if you're investing in the long run.  The one that I linked, the 2055 fund, is currently 90% stock and 10% bond (both split between US and International)."

2019-12-31 19:34:54,Or Bitcoin
2019-12-31 19:35:20,Well my belief is so the phone doesn’t burn up(protect consumer and themselves). It’s just not capable of running fortnite the way it can be ran. It’s like when I tried to mine Bitcoin with a laptop. Sure it was fine for an hour or two but I left the program running all night and now the thing won’t stay on without AC power source.
2019-12-31 19:35:36,off topic but what's up with the fake elon musk in the replies posting pictures about giving away bitcoin? that link is 100% leading to some kind of malware and the posts just aren't getting deleted for some reason
2019-12-31 19:37:09,There’s also a limited amount of bitcoin in circulation.
2019-12-31 19:39:35,Download a wallet from electrum.org  Transfer the bitcoin to your wallet.  Paypal hasn't been an option for awhile.
2019-12-31 19:39:49,"Oh boy. As usual in Coingeek's gish gallop posts, there's a lot to unpack. I'll just focus on the paragraph I find most amusing:  &gt; ### Stepping up as Satoshi  &gt; Although Dr. Wright has stated in the past that he was Satoshi Nakamoto and invented Bitcoin, 2019 was the year where he really started fighting to prove that was the case. In May, he was granted his copyright claim for the Bitcoin whitepaper and original code. He also took steps to prove his claim in court, filing libel cases against those that called him a fraud, cases he expects to see a favorable end to in 2020.  &gt; His choice to seek out the courts, rather than hide from them, is a testament to what he’s always fought for in Bitcoin. Rather than seek refuge from the law, like some of the more criminal elements which have corrupted BTC, he’s tried to shine light on every truth he has to wipe away all doubt to the contrary.  Craig has been trying hard to convince anybody that would listen that he was Satoshi since at least 2015, with previous efforts to convince targeted parties such as the Australian Taxation Office going back to at least 2014.  Regarding Craig's lofty allegations that filing for a copyright claim proved anything, the US copyright office took the extraordinary step of issuing [a press release for the **sole purpose** of invalidating craig's allegations]( precising in particular that ""The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statement made"", then further down also hinting at a potential consequence of Craig's actions: ""Someone who intentionally includes false information in an application may be subject to criminal penalties.""  Then of course, we have the libel cases, all filed in the UK, coincidentally the only jurisdiction in which libel laws give Craig the slimmest hope that he might have a case. But one does not need to wait until 2020 to see how that's going. One of those cases, against Rover Ver, was [already resolved in 2019]( To quote the article linked:  &gt; The case was thrown out of court on grounds that it was “weak,” “lacking in detail,” and “inappropriate.”  Incidentally, the court [ordered Craig to pay Ver's legal fees]( (about $73,000.)  Will Craig's other, eerily similar libel cases, filed in the same court as the above slam-dunk, fare any better? Probably not, but stay tuned.  Craig should start to get used to paying his opponent's legal fees, because that's also what he was recently ordered to do in the Kleiman trial in Florida, shortly after two federal judges asserted that Craig had repeatedly perjured himself in their court, in sharp contrast with Coingeek's unsupported claim that Craig ""tried to shine light on every truth"". But don't take my word for it:   On August 15 2019, US District Judge [Beth Bloom issued an order]( that included the following gems:  &gt; ***“Oh! What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.”*    Sir Walter Scott, Marmion (1808).**    ^   &gt; Indeed, the Court notes that the Defendant has made ***several conflicting statements*** regarding even his own ownership of W&amp;K.   ^   &gt; Unfortunately, the record is replete with instances in which the Defendant has proffered conflicting sworn testimony before this Court. In weighing the evidence, the Court simply does not find the Defendant’s testimony to be credible.   The Defendant being Craig. All emphasis kept from the original court decision.  A few days later, on August 27 2019, US Magistrate Judge [Bruce Reinhart issued an order]( that aligned rather well with Judge Bloom's:  &gt; Apparently, dead men tell no tales, but they (perhaps) send bonded couriers. (...) I completely reject Dr. Wright’s testimony about the alleged Tulip Trust, the alleged encrypted file, and his alleged inability to identify his bitcoin holdings.   &gt; Dr. Wright’s story not only was not supported by other evidence in the record, it defies common sense and real-life experience.   ^   &gt; During his testimony, Dr. Wright’s demeanor did not impress me as someone who was telling the truth. When it was favorable to him, Dr. Wright appeared to have an excellent memory and a scrupulous attention to detail. Otherwise, Dr. Wright was belligerent and evasive. He did not directly and clearly respond to questions. He quibbled about irrelevant technicalities. When confronted with evidence indicating that certain documents had been fabricated or altered, he became extremely defensive, tried to sidestep questioning, and ultimately made vague comments about his systems being hacked and others having access to his computers. None of these excuses were corroborated by other evidence.   ^   &gt; There was substantial credible evidence that documents produced by Dr. Wright to support his position in this litigation are fraudulent. There was credible and compelling evidence that documents had been altered. Other documents are contradicted by Dr. Wright’s testimony or declaration. While it is true that there was no direct evidence that Dr. Wright was responsible for alterations or falsification of documents, there is no evidence before the Court that anyone else had a motive to falsify them. As such, there is a strong, and unrebutted, circumstantial inference that Dr. Wright willfully created the fraudulent documents.  &gt; One example is the Deed of Trust document for the Tulip Trust.   ^   &gt; Combining these facts with my observations of Dr. Wright’s demeanor during his testimony, I find that Dr. Wright’s testimony that this Trust exists was intentionally false.   &gt; Dr. Wright’s false testimony about the Tulip Trust was part of a sustained and concerted effort to impede discovery into his bitcoin holdings.   It goes on, but hopefully you get the gist of it. Read the blistering court order linked above if you want to get the full effect.  Craig Wright's behavior in court has not been the behavior of a honest man, and Coingeek's choice of words for their article's title is deeply ironic."
2019-12-31 19:40:45,Another myth concerning Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
2019-12-31 19:43:51,"It’s funny, because you can literally make bitcoin in a smart contract on ethereum, with mining!"

2019-12-31 19:48:40,Nothing new but great advice. It adds up fast especially when you invest it. I saved $300 a month when I quit cigarettes and I wish I had put it into bitcoin at the time. It was maybe $300 a coin then... o well I’m still smoke free and enjoy the extra cash for toys and dinner with my wife
2019-12-31 19:50:15,"I don't know why it got downvoted, but I'd guess maybe people don't trust bull bitcoin. I have only seen it mentioned once or twice, so it definitely doesn't have the trust that Shakepay has. Personally I wouldn't risk my coins on a lesser known exchange, but I haven't heard anything bad about bull bitcoin either so I won't tell you not to use it."
2019-12-31 19:54:24,yup that's why tons of people are mining LMAO. Without mining bitcoin don't exist.
2019-12-31 19:56:21,yeah same for my quadrant(s). gay weed sex child slave owner bitcoin is funny only a few times.
2019-12-31 19:56:31,The same way everyone was using weed? The whole point of creating Bitcoin was - how do we make an illegal central bank that cannot be killed by the government.
2019-12-31 19:57:33,This is good for bitcoin.
2019-12-31 19:58:13,And that purchase helped bitcoin gain value as a currency.
2019-12-31 19:58:24,do you have evidence that futures are killing Bitcoin? (price decline after CME is not evidence that futures are killing Bitcoin because the volume was very small in the first weeks of trading).
2019-12-31 19:59:03,"#####&amp;#009;  ######&amp;#009;  ####&amp;#009;  &gt; # [Las empresas argentinas que cotizan en la Bolsa porteña y en Wall Street perdieron USD 11.000 millones en 2019]( &gt;  &gt;    &gt;    &gt;   [Los ADR repuntaron 20% en diciembre, pero no pudieron revertir el derrumbre acumulado en 2019.]( &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Los ADR repuntaron 20% en diciembre, pero no pudieron revertir el derrumbre acumulado en 2019.  &gt;  &gt;  Tal como sucedió en 2018, la [**recesión económica y la devaluación**]( del peso contagió este año a las acciones de las compañías argentinas. Al analizar el desempeño de la capitalización bursátil de las empresas locales cuyas acciones se negocian en dólares en los mercados externos, queda en evidencia el **daño que causó su exposición al “riesgo argentino”** y la incertidumbre política y económica de los últimos meses. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  **También quedó manifiesta una dolorosa realidad: las compañías argentinas cuyo modelo de negocios se sostiene por sus operaciones fuera del país cerraron un 2019 con apreciables ganancias, mientras que las que dependen del mercado doméstico sufrieron un castigo quizás exagerado en sus valuaciones.** &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  Esta “grieta” financiera se profundizó a partir de las elecciones primarias del 11 de agosto, cuyas consecuencias políticas son conocidas por todos –el triunfo de **Alberto Fernández** sobre **Mauricio Macri**-, pero que en los mercados se tradujeron en el control de cambios y la inminente reestructuración de la deuda, con el desplome generalizado de las acciones y los bonos. **Basta recordar que el lunes de 12 agosto, la primera rueda tras los comicios, el panel líder** [**S&amp;P Merval cayó 46% en dólares**]( &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  [Image](  &gt;  &gt;  Por eso no extraña que las empresas argentinas que cotizan en el exterior, pero no en el mercado local, hayan destacado por sus alzas, acordes al excelente año financiero que atravesaron las bolsas internacionales. Por ejemplo, todos los indicadores de Wall Street alcanzaron cifras récord sobre el cierre del año: el Dow Jones de Industriales acumuló una ganancia de 21% en 2019; el S&amp;P 500, un 27%, y el tecnológico Nasdaq, un 32 por ciento. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  Para **Mercado Libre**, el gigante del _e-commerce_ que preside **Marcos Galperin**, la suba anual fue de **99,4%**, un repunte extraordinario que implica haber duplicado su valor bursátil, de USD 14.545 millones a fines de 2018, a los **USD 29.002 millones** de hoy. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt; &gt; **Mercado Libre subió 99% en 2019 y sumó casi USD 15.000 millones a su valor bursátil** &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  **Según este parámetro, Mercado Libre es por amplio margen la empresa argentina más grande, pues el resto de las compañías de origen nacional cuyas acciones se negocian en Nueva York, sumadas, apenas superan los USD 40.000 millones.** &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  **Tenaris** dejó de cotizar en la Bolsa de Buenos Aires en octubre pasado. Sin la siderúrgica, líder mundial en la producción de caños sin costura para la industria petrolera, la plaza local perdió a uno de sus mejores activos. Su ADR **subió en el año un 6,1%**, lo que elevó la valuación bursátil de la multinacional de 12.498 a **13.260 millones** de dólares. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  También “salvó” el año **Despegar**. La empresa de servicios turísticos online concentra el 60% de su negocio en su filial brasileña Decolar. Su ADR **avanzó 8,1%** en doce meses y su capitalización bursátil mejoró desde los USD 786,7 millones del año pasado a los USD 929 millones. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt; &gt; **Los ADR de la 15 empresas que cotizan en simultáneo en Buenos Aires y Nueva York perdieron en conjunto USD 11.502 millones** &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  No fue así el caso de **Corporación América**, la empresa de **Eduardo Eurnekian** que administra medio centenar de terminales aeroportuarias en América Latina y Europa y que salió a cotizar en 2018 directamente en Wall Street. La matriz de Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 **perdió 9,5%** en el año y su valuación bursátil cedió a USD 960 millones, desde los USD 1.061 millones de 2018. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  **Mientras que estas cuatro compañías sumadas añadieron un valor USD 15.260 millones, las otras 15 empresas argentinas cuyas acciones cotizan en simultáneo en Buenos Aires y Nueva York acumularon en 2019 una baja en conjunto de USD 11.502 millones en su capitalización bursátil.** &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt; &gt; **El mercado local está cerrando mejor de lo que se podía llegar a pensar en agosto y septiembre (Corujo)** &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  “La esperanza del mercado era que este año fuera mejor que el anterior. 2018 había sido para el olvido. Producto de una crisis multicausal, había azotado las carteras de inversión de la peor manera desde 2008”, explicó **Nery Persichini**, estratega de GMA Capital. “**Pero 2019 estuvo en las antípodas de las expectativas y la decepción fue mayúscula. Hasta agosto, la incertidumbre electoral fue un factor común que contaminó con volatilidad a todos los activos financieros**. El quiebre de las PASO y el desenlace de octubre aceleraron la erosión”, acotó. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  El peor desempeño lo obtuvo la distribuidora eléctrica **Edenor**, cuyo ADR totalizó una **baja de 76,5%** en dólares en 2019, ante previsión de un nuevo período de atraso tarifario bajo la administración del Frente de Todos. En este rubro también sobresalieron las caídas para **Transportadora Gas del Sur** (-51,7%), **Pampa Energía** (-47,2%) y **Central Puerto** (-47%). &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt; &gt; **En 2019, Banco Macro desplazó al Grupo Galicia en el podio como mayor entidad financiera privada** &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  Las acciones de los bancos también atravesaron un gravoso 2019. La tenencia de títulos públicos en cartera y la devaluación debilitaron sus balances. **Grupo Galicia perdió 40,9%** y resignó más de USD 1.600 millones de valor bursátil, de USD 3.948 millones a USD 2.333 millones al cabo de un año. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  Esta baja provocó que **Banco Macro** desplazara en 2019 a Galicia en el podio como mayor entidad financiera privada: **restó sólo 18%**, desde los 3.666 a los 3.060 millones de dólares. En tanto, la capitalización bursátil de **Banco Francés cayó a la mitad**, para ceder unos 1.400 millones de dólares. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  Al ADR de **Banco Supervielle** le fue peor que al Bitcoin: se hundió 57% en 2019 y en los últimos dos años amplió su pérdida a un 88 por ciento. Al final de 2017 se transaba a USD 32 en Nueva York y ahora el papel vale 3,74 dólares. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt; &gt; **Una crisis multicausal azotó a las carteras de inversión de la peor manera desde 2008 (Persichini)** &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  Asimismo, para una empresa emblema de la Argentina como la petrolera estatal **YPF**, el balance del 2019 no fue del todo malo. **Cayó 13,7%** en dólares, frente al [**promedio de 31% que cedió el S&amp;P Merval**]( el “contado con liquidación”) y hoy, en USD 11,55, su ADR consolidó una **recuperación de 42% desde su piso** histórico de USD 8,13 del 3 de septiembre, cuatro meses atrás, con el sostén del potencial desarrollo de **Vaca Muerta** y el ascenso de los precios del crudo. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  [Fuente: GMA Capital]( GMA Capital  &gt;  &gt;  **Sabrina Corujo**, directora de Portfolio Personal Inversiones, apuntó que “el mercado local está [**cerrando mejor de lo que se podría haber pensado**]( agosto y septiembre, pero claramente mucho más complicado que las expectativas que se tenían a fines del 2018 e incluso principios de 2019”. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  “Dicho esto, no descartamos que el mercado pueda seguir subiendo, aunque entendemos que el ritmo con el que lo haga será menor al de las últimas semanas e incluso no se pueden descartar correcciones o arbitrajes puntuales”, agregó Corujo. &gt;  &gt;   &gt;  &gt;  [Fuente: GMA Capital en base a FMI]( GMA Capital en base a FMI  &gt;   &gt; ***(continues in next comment)***"
2019-12-31 19:59:13,I think of it like this to calculate it. Maybe this sounds dumb to others but this is how I do it on 'MEX: Take the amount of Bitcoin you want to bet. Multiply that by  (roughly) the current price. Then take that number and multiply it by your leverage.  That is the number of contracts you then enter into the trade with - making sure to set the leverage correct.  Does this make sense?

When I was a kid I was very tech-savvy and tried to convince my dad to invest in Apple when Steve Jobs returned and switched the MacOS to run on UNIX.  I tried MacOS 10.2 and was convinced this was going to be very successful.  Same with the iPod.  Dad laughed and said I should invest my own money.  I was a kid.   I had the same deal with Tesla, but I saw how much the stock skyrocketed after the IPO and figured ""Eh, I'm too late, it was too hyped by release day, people are overpaying.""  I was wrong.  I also was very familiar with Bitcoin when it first came out, I thought ""I won't invest in something speculative like this, but I should set my computer up to do some mining"" many times and never bothered.

So you saying grandmas etc know what it is, is false if not downright disingenuous as they’ve heard about it but they sure as hell don’t know what it is. Hell lets do an experiment, go out and ask atleast 10 random people, have you heard of bitcoin? most will say yes. But then proceed to ask them. What is it or why does it exist?

Without Ver, his money, and his desperate website, BCH would be worth nothing (although it's trending down towards that anyway, lol).  Where else would BCH attract victims from?  The best part about you BCH nuts is that you all secretly still hold Bitcoin.  Same with Roger.  If he would have actually gone all in on BCH after the split, he'd be dead broke.  But because deep down, he still believes Bitcoin is valuable, he's still extremely wealthy.  So I'll ask you.  Did you trade all your Bitcoin for BCH after the fork?  I bet you didn't.  I bet you still hold Bitcoin because you recognize it's value as an unconfiscatable digital gold, and a censorship resistant medium of exchange.  You're all fucking hypocrites.  Meanwhile, I (and everyone else who exposes BCH as the scam that it is) have dumped our BCH after the split.  I wouldn't be caught dead holding this worthless shitcoin."

A capital loss can only count against other capital gains though, not income. Also if you did any trading in 2018 you should have included those gains/losses on that years taxes, even if it ends up all being lost later.  &gt; I have heard we are getting something like 1$ per bitcoin and 75 cents for an ethereum  No one knows the amount that might be recovered.

2019-12-31 20:24:16,"Ofcourse it can. If Bitcoin can hit $21,000+ and Ethereum $1000+ then any crypto that becomes successful has the potential to moon in price.

2019-12-31 20:27:32,"&gt; The person who created the protocol laid out a vision for scaling the system over time as the need arises.  I think Satoshi had a brilliant idea for a system and some great ideas/predictions/guesses on how it could develop and grow, but was obviously wrong/mistaken about some things, and wouldn’t have claimed to know the future or exactly how the network would evolve at scale. I also think that collectively we know a lot more today than he did about the practical reality of what works and what doesn’t, and would be foolish not to use that to make adjustments just because it doesn’t perfectly resemble a founder’s best guess.  &gt; I think the onus is on you to prove that vision doesn't work. It would be working just fine without the artificial limitation imposed by the stubborn devs and BCH as well as the many other cryptos working without a second layer solution are proof of that.  I think you’ve got your logic backwards - we can’t ‘prove’ a negative, and I’m under no obligation to run code or support development if I’m skeptical of it’s longterm future.   You’re free to prove your theory *right*, but that obviously hasn’t happened yet, BCH’s blocks are much smaller (~15%) than BTC’s, let alone 32x+ larger. Go show me a network running steady in the 10’s of MB that doesn’t have distributed validation fall off a relative cliff and i’ll say I was mistaken, but until then I’m fine with other approaches to scaling.  &gt; You also seem to forget that the opening paragraphs of the whitepaper explain how the system is meant to be viable for microtransactions, one of its biggest benefits over centralized ledgers. Why are we so hasty to throw that away?  I haven’t forgotten anything, and supporting very small tx is one of the many reasons i think LN is a great path forward for bitcoin."
2019-12-31 20:28:09,Same as your Bitcoin wallet. You forgot your private key you lost all your Bitcoin and no one in the world and touch those Bitcoin.    One way is to hack the software or ask NSA to use their Quantum Computer to brute force find your password.
2019-12-31 20:28:54,"My point is that Craig Wright being Satoshi is a crucial part of BSV being what it is. His making that false claim over a multi-year campaign to dupe people is the only thing that has allowed him to worm himself into the Bitcoin community and ultimately fork it into his own little fiefdom.  No sane person would gloss over the Chief Scientist of the primary developers of the BSV blockchain having lied through their teeth about who they were to get to where they are.  Now is the Tulip Trust being a fraudulent fabrication (as described by a US federal judge: [""I find that Dr. Wright’s testimony that this Trust exists was intentionally false.""]( sufficient to convince BSV optimists as yourself that Craig is a liar and a fraud? It ought to be, but it probably won't be.  You are entirely too willing to pretend that the lies you were served did not really matter, that Craig's repeated behavior should not discredit him, and as a result, you will continue to support something that was built on fraud and deceit from its inception.  If the frauds were to get expelled from the ""Bitcoin-SV ecosystem"", and there were still something left standing afterward, maybe there would be something to talk about. We could talk about the massive miner centralization to come as an inevitable consequence of nChain's recent technical choices, and how BSV's new mechanism to allow dominant miners to trash smaller miners will only accelerate that effect.  But until that happens, BSV is simply too tainted by its leadership for that kind of discussions to be meaningful."

2019-12-31 20:33:40,If Bitcoin is valued at 500k by 2030 the that would mean about 700k every 10 minutes plus fees. Currently Bitcoin reward are 90k plus fees.    I don't the block reward as the problem as the usage of the network as the problem.   With that value a lot of people would be using Bitcoin so we need to be ready to be able to process that amount of txs.

They're super conservative. Idk if it's the same sub situation but for instance I would never dream of saying the word Bitcoin on the FIRE subreddit. It's just not their style.  Both are subreddits for super conservative investors trying to max out a 401k that's really all it is.  I get the frustration. But if I was one of those super conservative Roth IRA and 401k makers who thought the dollar would live forever I wouldn't want us Bitcoin Degenerates in there either.  Have you read half the ""investment"" advice here? Outside of serious situations it's basically ""Neglect the thing and actually buy more BTC instead of selling like you're asking"". Its a degenerate style of investing if you're an outsider looking in.  I say fair play.   Just as well if they came here trying to talk about maxing their 401k... they wouldn't be allowed. Sounds fair enough to me."
2019-12-31 20:39:32,"Your strategy is almost equivalent to going and betting 3.5 K on the roulette on red. ~%50% chances you get 7K back, so that you can buy your one Bitcoin with 3.5K only.  But also 50% chances of losing 3.5K, which is what would happen if BTC goes up 50% and you realized you did not buy at 7K, hence you virtually lost 3.5K in  a purchase you did not do due to greed.  tl,dr: what you are doing is a bet, don't do it unless you don't mind beating over yourself later. Use dollar cost average and don't think more about it."
2019-12-31 20:40:05,"Human nature is pretty greedy. That's just the reality of this area of tech that mixes in money. Lecturing people to not be as they are by nature is pointless.  I expect at some point the 'cool' Bitcoin people will turn over to be the new generation of young people who wrote some software or launched a business/service that earns them an income stream of Bitcoin. As frameworks and tools mature, that will be more achievable and the creative entrepreneurs that capitalize on the opportunity will be rewarded.

Maybe being friends with those people would have changed your life drastically if you'd just said hello to them.  This is one of the best comments I've seen on Reddit in a long time.  It goes the same for- going to the gym all those times you should have, talking to that girl you really liked, reading that book you really should have and as meaningless as ""picking last week's lottery number"".  The real question is- you've watched the rise and rise of bitcoin over the past nine years, are you really going to sit there as a no-coiner for the next nine and still complain to us again in the same way?"

2019-12-31 20:47:05,"The only similarity between Napster and Lightening Network at all is that they both added a centralized networking pool over otherwise decentralized systems (in Napster's case, it was little more than a centrally indexed search engine over an otherwise decentralized peer-to-peer network). Napster didn't even offer streaming, let alone pioneered it (especially since streaming already existed, again, for many years before Napster).   The only other similarities between Napster (or Limewire, or Kazaa, or any of the multitude of file-sharing technologies of the day) and LN or Bitcoin is that the only realistic use-case for the technology was to facilitate illegal activities and its idiotic fans give it far more credit than it deserves for shaping modern services.  Napster's contribution to internet history is little more than trivial. Streaming services owe more to Apple and the iTunes Music Store and other centralized, legal services for their existence than they do to the piracy pioneers."

2019-12-31 20:55:48,"Thank you so much for your feedback and corrections. I know crypto purely from a user (a.k.a. developer) perspective, so I am always edgy that some of my assumptions are wrong somewhere.  &gt;ECC verification is generally slower than RSA, but uses less memory. ECC signing is about the same or faster, depending on architecture.  I didn't bring up signing and verification because I haven't implemented it yet. Not after I saw the computation times required, that changed my mind from verifying each message or just verify during initial authentication.  &gt;All this goes out the window if you have hardware crypto, either built into your micro or on an external accelerator.  Sadly, in the world of below ARM Cortex-A series, this is rarely available in-die, so definitely out of reach of hobbyists, like myself. You can get some crypto modules, but they're stuck in 10+ year old primitives. Even on modern hardware (smartphones), hardware crypto accelerators take so long to the low end market that Google was forced use a CPU base crypto for their low-end systems. But I'm sure you already know what submission was that :)  &gt;In general, ECC (ECDSA for signing/verification, ECDH for key exchange),  Thank you for the correction, I always get these mixed up.  &gt;fast hash (Blake2s), but be aware that if you're depending on existing infrastructure (eg PKI) you might end up needing to at least verify RSA certs since some CAs have those in their chains (IIRC all the major public root certs are still RSA, they should be expiring over the next few years).  Excellent tip, I'll have to keep that in mind for my IoT projects, since those work on the web.  &gt;Also if you're using ASCON you get ASCON-HASH and ASCON-XOF for a hash, MAC, and KDF all in the same code as your AEAD! Very handy if code size is a major constraint, though slower than Blake2s according to supercop.  Please tell me your bitcoin address so I can buy you a beer. I had no idea I had these available, since I clearly lack in research and there's no API for that in the library I use, I'll have to dig deeper. Also I only implemented my first key expansion yesterday :p  This massively simplifies the memory footprint of the crypto stuff I use, thank you so much!  &gt;Edit: you might consider the proposed Blake2x (draft) as an XOF (expansion/KDF/CSPRNG). Not finalized yet though.  I'l look into it, probably leave a hole in the protocol so I can switch MAC hashers later.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit:  Took a pass on the Blake2x proposal....  &gt;Deterministic random bit generator (DRBG): Given a high-entropy seed, BLAKE2X produces a stream of up to 256GiB.   &gt;   &gt;• Key derivation function (KDF): Given input key material (and an optional salt, as allowed by the BLAKE2 parameter block), BLAKE2X computes a key of up to 232 − 2 bytes (about 4GiB). BLAKE2X’s extract-then-expand scheme is similar (but not identical) to that of HKDF  Now, I'm not exactly a crypto nerd, but I am literally drooling."

Things like weather app, testing transactions, consolidating transactions, etc.  Things that obscure the true number of actual users transferring coins to other users.  BSV is bouncing off it's lows of $30 Million per day (30 day average)    BCH still does nearly 10 times that.  BCH hasn't had a single day this year below $100 Million being sent on chain.  BSV has had only 7 days in the past 5 months above $100 Million.  Not a single day of 2019 has BSV had more dollar value transacted on it than BCH.  BCH's busiest day of the year saw $9.65 Billion Dollars transacted.  BSV's busiest day of the year (3 days later) saw just $1.03 Billion transacted.    BSV's monetary usage is equivalent to Bitcoin in February of 2013, which would put BSV's price at less than $20.  BCH's monetary usage is equivalent to Bitcoin in May of 2014, which would put BCH's price at around $450. Or Bitcoin in June of 2015 @ $250.  BTC's monetary usage is equivalent to Bitcoin in June of 2017, which would put BTC's price at around $2400. Or BTC in July of 2018 @ $6400. Or BTC in April of 2019 @ $4800.    The relationship between usage and price is quite clear in that last chart."
2019-12-31 21:19:28,"You have already paid for the hardware though and since you do not necessarily have an alternative use of it I cannot see how you are actually making profit. You only will do so if you reach ROI. If however the ROI date goes further and further away (as it is the case with Bitcoin mining) then you actually made a loss, no?  Obviously mining during crypto booms makes sense. But what about someone starting today with no sense of crypto boom in sight? Would you recommend him to do so, or would he see his ROI date going further and further away?  Or alternatively if -indeed- a new crypto boom is in sight, why simply not buy the coins with the same money you are buying the hardware. That way you do not need to learn a new skill (that may not be otherwise useful) *and* ride the lightning in an even more intense sense (bitcoin millionaires were made mostly by buying instead of mining).  I am not trying to dissuade you or anything. I am honestly trying to understand the mind of a small- medium miner. If you are big enough and can corner the market ok, you can manipulate prices and make money. If you are small though and only expect the market to go up to trully ROI why not simply buy the coin to begin with?"

Which puts me, an honest man, at a disadvantage. The risks out way the benefits for me. One thing is certain, BTC will be DEAD in 2 years and BSV, the real Bitcoin, will remain as king.

Speculating on future adoption when there is no utility other then the grater fool's theory on investing is not a solid adoption strategy.   Bitcoin is not dead, the only version of Bitcoin that is optimizing for mass adoption is BSV. Being able to scale when needed is a fundamental requirement. Has anyone ever limited the number of internet requests per 10 minutes intervals the internet would never have been adopted. In fact our monetary system depends on, there being no limits to the number of transactions one can make."
2019-12-31 21:46:35,The biggest opportunity I ever missed was when a huge zero day exploit came out and hackers used it to encrypt a lot of people’s data with ransom wear and then demanded bitcoin to unlock.

2019-12-31 22:08:32,"The thing with this addition algorithm is along with what you said, it can't be used for other cryptographic stuff which SSS can be used for.  A real world example, it is sort of technical but I'll try to abstract the the technicalities. Although you might need some basic cryptography knowledge.  The multisig (multi-signature) implementation in Bitcoin. It allows arbitrary M signatures of N shares implementation directly at the protocol level to make a transaction (not to be confused with the Bitcoin seed example /u/standupmaths made in the video).   Now what we require is every one of the M signatures to individually sign a transaction and publicly broadcast the signature without resulting in their private share being revealed obviously. But you also need a way to verify the M signatures combined actually forms your main secret (let's call it PR) but also without any of the M parties getting any knowledge of the other shares and their information.  We'll not get into the algorithms for that, as frankly they go a little over my head too but only SSS is a standard with some modifications that allow us to do all of this things simultaneously. I'm almost the your addition algorithm can't do that without leaking the share of other users to another shareholder after the first use. It might work if I suppose it is an application where you only need the secret once."

2019-12-31 22:35:21,"&gt;if you're a merchant accepting funds from customers and your shop loses power taking your LN node offline any merchant can attempt to steal from you by transmitting an older LN channel state. you need to hire watchtowers to help prevent this.  Again, this is only true if your node is offline for longer than your `to_self_delay`, which you can set up to two weeks. You only need watchtowers if your node might be offline for longer than your `to_self_delay`. A merchant is never going to be offline for that long.  &gt;1 day, 2 weeks is still distincitly worse than waiting 10 minutes for 1 confirmation on Bitcoin.  That clearly depends on your operational priorities. Waiting 10 minutes (or occasionally over an hour) for a confirmation is quite often unacceptable in a retail point-of-sale environment. The merchant can risk accepting an on-chain transaction without any confirmations, but that is absolutely less secure than accepting a Lightning payment.  &gt; Saying both the have the same exact level of security is just plain deceitful.  I didn't say that."

2019-12-31 22:41:11,"Hi. I do all kind of trading and definitely I'm still learning. Just recently I have been starting to be profitable with normal financial markets, and it has taken me 3 years to get here. I started trading with Bitcoin and was able to get out soon enough with decent profits, but that wasn't real trading since even blind monkey could make money in crypto world in second half of 2017. Trading actual established financial markets is way harder.  It's not difficult technically to execute trading just press some buttons on computer, but developing probabilistic mind set and getting emotions out of the way can take long time, and those are crucial charasteristic for any long term survival in the markets. In trading you loose often. How often depends on your strategy. The idea is to loose just a little compared to possible win. Overtime those odds play in your favour and you have a chance to be in profit.  One trading type I do is day trade futures. In futures you can create decent income with relatively small account size. Maybe 5k-10k account size and you can aim for 150$-300$ daily target. This however comes with high risk and it's very easy to destroy your account in one day, if you cannot trade and manage your risk properly. For me it took 1 year and couple of blown accounts before I was able to do that. If you are interested in this, I highly recommend tradepro academy for their community, top notch teaching materials and their daily trading room. It costs, but it's worth it imo. They are not shortcut to riches, you still need to do the work, but at least it's a good environment for learning."
2019-12-31 22:42:19,"It's honestly scary, and really reminds me of the $20k bitcoin days on /r/Bitcoin.

But at least unlike BTC, TSLA is a real company with real fundamentals and real revenue/products, so it obviously has a strong support somewhere, but yes, a short term correction is indeed a real possibility."
2019-12-31 22:45:06,"Bitcoin has grown is all. The cypherpunks and anarchists are still here. Part of bitcoins success relies on people's greed. Beyond the philosophical reasons to get involved in Bitcoin, without a financial incentive it would never grow beyond the small group of freedom activists that originally supported and built bitcoin.  A world where Bitcoin plays a large part requires/forces changes to global governance,  regardless of the intentions or beliefs of the participants. It's not necessary for all participants to believe in the freedom principles behind Bitcoin in order for those properties to impact the world. Just as it doesnt matter how many people want and believe in freedom who use fiat, it doesn't change the way fiat has shaped global governance.  I cant speak for everyone, but I believe Bitcoin achieved a certain kind of critical mass in 2017 and is essentially guaranteed to continue gaining relevance in global governance. It doesnt need the fervent adoption efforts that the community used to rally behind."

When you hold a balance on LN you hold an expectation for a future Bitcoin settlement that may or may not actually happen in the future.  Your balance is not written to the system of record and is known only to you and your channel partner.  Just like a bar tab.  &gt; ""LN turns BTC into a fractional reserve system""  Jury's out.  I don't think this has been proven yet, but I have not seen evidence to prove it impossible.  Some of the ideas being floated around for magically solving liquidity have the sniff of FR AFAIC.   If you follow the story of the invention of FR (banks act as deposit houses for precious metals, issuing IOUs to other banking accounts that can be settled at some point in the future for the underlying metal, and then taking the next step to offering IOUs that are only partially backed by the underlying settlement asset) then I think the natural progression of LN is concerning.   &gt; ""your funds will be stolen the second you go offline""  The second you go offline?  No, haven't heard that one.  If you are offline for long enough, yes, that's possible.  &gt; ""you lose control over your funds""  You lose exclusive control over your funds. A Lightning Channel is a kind of joint custody of the funds.  &gt; ""there are no mobile wallets for LN""  Was this a thing?  I find your list to be mostly strawmen that nobody really said.  Past that, a few things you are stating as if they are false, when they are true."
2019-12-31 23:02:06,"The best thing about this article is how everything is good for bitcoin. It has a bit about how it's hard to use as a currency and it's under regulatory scrutiny.   It's just such a simple basic first-mover situation. It's a nice easy basic cryptocurrency. Onto that, the scrutiny like by taxes, means that people are less likely to spend, which constricts market supply (good for bitcoin). If the use case as a store of value goes up enough, that's great.  Then, if the gain in user base is linear, then by Metcalfe's law, the gains are still exponential. If people think that at these prices adoption is low, wait til adoption doubles. Ah. Good times.   Anyway, enjoy the oncoming year 2020, it should be fun and exciting."
2019-12-31 23:05:53,"Facepalming myself until I bleed. It's hard money. Hard money, not Fiat. It's not pure speculation you fools. Nobody puts 200B in an asset to speculate. Read Bitcoin the standard and you will understand the value of bitcoin. It has intrinsic value. Much more than gold or any possible currency."
2019-12-31 23:06:35,"There is nothing stupid about it.   What is speculative about the best investment performance of the decade?  If any stock or ETF or traditional commodity performed like bitcoin did, each and every person in that stupid sub would be pumping it similarly.   Instead, they are expressing their abiding butthurt.  I wonder how long it takes for people to realize that bitcoin is just as stable and predictable as any commodity asset."
2019-12-31 23:11:24,It does not seem like it would be a game changer unless/until Bitcoin becomes completely mainstream.
2019-12-31 23:13:16,"An endorsement of what? These are people who choose to live a life where they are constantly in mortal danger from everyone. Friends and enemies, governments and private citizens.   Their goal is to move funds. They dont make it by using crypto. They make it by selling drugs.  So drug lords have a great use for bitcoin. But how does that work for you?   You gotta move millions clandestinely,"
2019-12-31 23:16:55,"&gt;Amazing. This is a great counter argument to the core trolls who say lightning uses onion routing. The real bitcoin bch will have Tor built into big blocks. BCH PLS!  1. That makes no sense.  Tor isn't ""built into big blocks"" 2. No, its not a great counterargument. 3. ""real bitcoin"" is a loser narrative."
2019-12-31 23:17:06,God I hope so. Bitcoin’s legacy needs to be wiped clean.  Or people could just stop buying bitcoin...
2019-12-31 23:17:21,These are cases that did well when bitcoin was on it's way down from 14k.
2019-12-31 23:22:17,Invest in bitcoin and study more.
2019-12-31 23:25:09,Not a mystery but more of a question. How did mining Bitcoin work? I know it used coding but I'm so confused
2019-12-31 23:29:18,"# hardcore spicy award goes to Jihan...  Jihan:  ""Ï think chinese government is right that keep some cautious, on the crypto currency things. First, china have capital control system, cryptocurrency needs to be regulated, or need to be controlled. Not to have too much negative impact over the exiting regulatory framework.""  [ 4:40  Later he say the bitcoin cash hash rate will drop in half suddenly but ""**dedicated** miners are watching the network"". Instead of properly incentivized miners, BCH relies on ""dedicated"" miners  He's referring to miners that are willing to mine at a 50% revenue loss during the next halving [ (97 days)  Jihan coin, requires protection from Jihan.  Today Jihan and friends need to get rid of the majority unknown miner that is currently gaming BCH's difficulty adjustment algorithm."
2019-12-31 23:30:28,Bitcoin fanatics always mention inflation. Your fiat is getting inflated blah blah blah. Then why should I exchange bitcoin that's about to go to the moon to one of the worst fiat currencies on the planet?
2019-12-31 23:30:46,"Possibly. One by one we're going to see the SVers fumble with their faith, and after the 5 stages of grief, they'll either come back to Bitcoin Cash or quit crypto; Win-win for us"
2019-12-31 23:34:07,Also Bitcoin

2019-12-31 23:39:26,"&gt; You have BCH for this  I know. That's what I was saying.   &gt; but still, most peer to peer payments are done using Bitcoin.  I'm not interested in bitcoin core.   &gt; Bitcoin is evolving into something greater the ""the original spec""  Greater? That's why I'm not interested in it."
2019-12-31 23:39:51,But how do all the millionaires get so rich from bitcoin?
2019-12-31 23:40:12,"Do most of them make money off of bitcoin, then invest into other things?"
2019-12-31 23:42:03,"Okay, also r u rich from bitcoin, or just rich?"
2019-12-31 23:42:25,"Bitcoin is a savings technology. It should never be viewed as an investment. do you find value in having complete control over your wealth? then bitcoin is for you. If you are looking to somehow generate more garbage government fiat, then bitcoin is probably not for you. Stick to stocks, and negative interest rate bonds for that."
2019-12-31 23:45:04,"For example a guy called Hisroyalcharles on Instagram, is really rich from bitcoin it says he’s a crypto and forex trading mogul, his net worth is 50 million dollars, I don’t understand how he is so rich??"
2019-12-31 23:45:13,"I'm not fan of voting. I believe it's just a hoax designed to make us think we are making a difference. However, spoiling your votes alone will not change things.  We need to hit them where it really hurts and vote with our money. Thanks to the wonders of fractional reserve lending, we only need 1 in 5 people to withdraw most of their money and park it in something like gold, silver or Bitcoin. When this happens, sit back and watch the banks panic as they close their doors to freeze withdrawals."
2019-12-31 23:48:07,"You don't buy bitcoin. You exchange. Bitcoin is a currency. You do not buy currency. When you visit Canada, do you buy Canadian dollars? No. You exchange. Bitcoin is the money of the internet. You exchange the money of government for it."
2019-12-31 23:48:37,So today bitcoin will stay around 1k-20k?
2019-12-31 23:48:48,Not as good but there’s a local billboard for a chiropractor which proudly proclaims “we accept bitcoin.”
2019-12-31 23:48:50,So there is no point in buying bitcoin
2019-12-31 23:49:59,"Bitcoin is stable.  It's all the other currencies that are wildly varying.  1 Bitcoin = 1/21,000,000th of the total."
2019-12-31 23:53:16,"Yes, because when I can't afford my rent next month because Bitcoin declined 25%, I'll be happy in the knowledge that I still have 1/21,000,000th of the total"
2019-12-31 23:53:42,Mine bitcoin
2019-12-31 23:55:24,Do you think one bitcoin will ever reach one million dollars? And what determines the price of it?
2019-12-31 23:57:15,And Bitcoin was supposed to be $35K by today.  These bozos know \*nothing\*
2019-12-31 23:57:54,Or back to the future it and go bet money on a big win then invest in Apple or Microsoft or Tesla or bitcoin or fucking anything.  Boom millionaire for life no crime no guilt no fucking anything up
2019-12-31 23:58:07,People arent selling  They are just withdrawing their custodied bitcoin from exchanges like coinbase and kraken
